1
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,756
How did those soldiers ever manage
to dig out these tunnels?

2
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,341
Let's get a rotation in here.

3
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:21,342
Hey, I found something!

4
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,319
Hanako...

5
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,738
<i>We soldiers dig.</i>

6
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,409
<i>We dig all day.</i>

7
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,287
<i>This is the hole that we will fight...</i>

8
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:49,374
<i>and die in.</i>

9
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,376
Hanako...

10
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:56,377
<i>am I digging my own grave?</i>

11
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:32,793
<i>Today, I head for the post
where my men await.</i>

12
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:37,794
<i>I am determined to serve
and give my life for my country.</i>

13
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,842
<i>I believe I have organized
everything at home...</i>

14
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:45,843
<i>but I am sorry I wasn't able to attend
to the kitchen floor before I left.</i>

15
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,100
<i>I had all the intention...</i>

16
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,852
<i>but had to leave
without having the time...</i>

17
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,188
<i>and I am still worried about it.</i>

18
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:58,189
<i>So make sure to have
Taro take care of it promptly.</i>

19
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:07,407
Damn this island!
The Americans can have it.

20
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,123
Nothing grows here.

21
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:16,124
It smells. It's hot. There are too many
damn bugs, and there's no water.

22
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:22,551
This island is part
of Japan's sacred homeland.

23
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:27,552
There's nothing sacred about this island.

24
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,766
<i>Sago.</i>

25
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:33,854
We should just give the island
to the Americans...

26
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:38,855
and then we can go home.

27
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,820
Saigo!

28
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:44,823
What did you say, soldier?

29
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:49,453
I said if we beat the Americans,
then we can go home.

30
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:53,039
You there, is that what he said?

31
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Yes, sir.

32
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,459
I'm Kuribayashi.

33
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,504
Welcome, General.
I am Admiral Ohsugi.

34
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:25,966
How long have you been
waiting here for me?

35
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,509
Three hours, sir.

36
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,052
Sorry to hear that.

37
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:33,849
They wouldn't allow me to wire my arrival
after what happened to Admiral Yamamoto.

38
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,225
I understand, sir.

39
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,727
This is my aide, Lieutenant Fujita.

40
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:40,438
What's the matter, Admiral?
You don't look very well.

41
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,942
It's nothing, sir. The water
doesn't agree with me here.

42
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:46,111
Sorry to hear that.

43
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:47,904
This way to your quarters.

44
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:50,699
Admiral, I want to make a round
of the island first.

45
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,909
Shall I fetch a vehicle?

46
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,871
No, let's walk.

47
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,664
Walking is good for the health.

48
00:06:57,665 --> 00:07:02,665
It might be just what you need, Ohsugi.

49
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:20,766
So that's Suribachi.

50
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,361
You unpatriotic...

51
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:30,155
no-good peasants!

52
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:35,156
Hey, Stop it!

53
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:37,245
Stand up!

54
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:41,333
What are you doing?

55
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:45,503
These soldiers...

56
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:48,548
were conspiring
with unpatriotic words, sir.

57
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:49,925
I see.

58
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:52,719
And, Captain, do you have
such an excess of soldiers...

59
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,264
that you could put two
of them out of commission?

60
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,391
No, sir.

61
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:00,393
Then stop beating them.

62
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:03,229
Deny their lunch rations instead.

63
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,230
A good captain uses his brain,
not just his whip.

64
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:14,282
What is all this?

65
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:15,784
All this?

66
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:17,786
Trenches, sir.

67
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:20,080
Why are the men digging trenches here?

68
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:24,751
This is where the Americans
are expected to land.

69
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:27,295
Have them stop immediately.

70
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:29,339
But, General--

71
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,383
And, Captain...

72
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:33,718
make sure these men get proper breaks.

73
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,719
They look like they're from Mars.

74
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:53,901
Stop digging!

75
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:10,171
Just as well.

76
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:14,217
My stomach has been
bothering me anyway.

77
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:18,138
A toast to General Kuribayashi...

78
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:23,139
a fine commander.

79
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:26,312
Better than sake!

80
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:29,274
I heard he lived in America.

81
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,901
Maybe that's why he
doesn't want us digging trenches.

82
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:33,862
Maybe he likes Americans.

83
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:38,863
No, stupid.
He studied the Americans.

84
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:44,039
So now he knows how to beat them.

85
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,583
I heard from someone in the 204th...

86
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:51,584
that another general was
supposed to command the island...

87
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,426
but he didn't want the job.

88
00:09:56,427 --> 00:10:01,427
So Premier Tojo gave it
to Kuribayashi instead.

89
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:06,849
Nozaki, you hear a lot of things...

90
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:11,024
but your ears are full of wax!

91
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:15,236
Anyway, you can't trust anyone
from the 204th.

92
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,447
They're part of the Navy.

93
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:20,992
I think this Kuribayashi
must be a superb general.

94
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:22,952
Look...

95
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:27,953
we're not digging those damn trenches
in the sand anymore, are we?

96
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:49,767
This heat is more than I had anticipated.

97
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:57,525
This island is bigger than I thought.
I'm exhausted.

98
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:06,538
Ito, reporting for duty.

99
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:09,833
Thank you for coming right away.

100
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,627
How much air force
do we have available?

101
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:15,421
41 Zekes and 13 bombers, sir.

102
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:16,589
Is that all?

103
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,590
In order to support Saipan,
we lost 66 planes a few days ago.

104
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:26,971
We will have to rely on support
from the Combined Fleet then.

105
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:33,686
Is this the current defense plan?

106
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:40,985
And what about the Army troops?
Where will they be stationed?

107
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,783
I don't know exactly.

108
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:46,828
They are under independent
command of Colonel Adaohi.

109
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:49,372
You have not coordinated
your plans with the Army?

110
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:52,292
According to Navy rules,
until the enemy lands--

111
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:57,293
This is a real war!
You are aware of that, aren't you?

112
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:02,677
This will not work.

113
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,555
You are concentrating all
your efforts on the beaches.

114
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:08,933
- Move the artillery to higher ground.
- But, sir, we just had them...

115
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:10,685
moved down to the beaches.

116
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:14,522
Well, move them back.

117
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,275
Coordinate with the Army
and have them start immediately.

118
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:20,820
Fortifications at Suribachi are the priority.

119
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:22,322
I'm going to walk some more.

120
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:27,323
- It's pitch black out there, sir.
- I know.

121
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:39,672
This one is trouble.

122
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:44,673
Army commanders usually are, sir.

123
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,303
Another letter?

124
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:30,848
You know that the mail only goes out
when there's a boat available?

125
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:32,809
I have a lot of family.

126
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,188
Then how come all your letters
are addressed to your wife?

127
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:38,564
Nosey!

128
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:40,733
Here, let me do you a favor.

129
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:45,071
Otherwise, your letters
will never make it through.

130
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:47,198
Hey, what are you doing?

131
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,619
I used to work at the censorship office
in Tokyo before I was transferred.

132
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,372
You mean demoted.

133
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:58,126
"To Hanako: We soldiers dig.
We dig all day."

134
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:02,797
No, no, no. This will never pass.

135
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:07,798
Give me that back!

136
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:18,183
There. You'll thank me
for this later, Saigo.

137
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Next!

138
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:34,074
Good!

139
00:14:56,894 --> 00:15:00,021
Are you blind?

140
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:03,149
Can't you see the target'?

141
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,737
Even my six-year-old could
shoot better than you do.

142
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:12,738
Do it again!

143
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:19,912
You're an embarrassment!
You call yourself an Imperial soldier?

144
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:24,087
Tonight you will clean the boots
of your entire troop.

145
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:27,673
Go to the rear!

146
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:32,674
They should learn to clean their guns
properly, rather than their boots.

147
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,048
What are those tanks doing here?

148
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:13,261
Those are out of commission, sir.
They are waiting for parts.

149
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:18,262
- For how long?
- About a month, sir.

150
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:40,246
<i>Taro, America is filled with cars.</i>

151
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:45,247
<i>I have to be very careful
when I cross the street...</i>

152
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:48,880
<i>there are so many cars everywhere.</i>

153
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:53,634
<i>Taro, are you behaving yourself
and listening to your mother?</i>

154
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:58,635
<i>I miss you.</i>

155
00:17:05,314 --> 00:17:09,775
These civilians need to be
evacuated as soon as possible.

156
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:14,776
Yes, sir.

157
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,799
Hanako...

158
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,301
<i>we have a celebrity here.</i>

159
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:22,056
<i>Baron Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist
in horse jumping.</i>

160
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:25,518
<i>He will lead the 26th tank regiment...</i>

161
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,519
<i>and has just arrived from Tokyo.</i>

162
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,370
<i>Nishi is very handsome, and there are
rumors of his womanizing skills.</i>

163
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:53,792
<i>But there are no women
left on the island to woo.</i>

164
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:23,034
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi!
You brought your horse.

165
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:28,035
From Chichi Jima.

166
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,543
I used to be a cavalryman myself,
you know.

167
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:34,879
Of course, I know.

168
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,883
I've been looking forward
to serving under you.

169
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:41,552
One who understands horses
the way I do.

170
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:45,890
When we used to ride horses
through the battlefield...

171
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:49,185
those were the good old days...

172
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:52,563
not like these mechanized contraptions.

173
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:55,650
I could send for another horse...

174
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:57,318
and we could ride together.

175
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,571
I'm afraid my riding days are over.

176
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:05,572
But tell me about this famous horse
of yours that you won the Olympics with.

177
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:11,244
My stallion, Uranus.

178
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:23,965
Oh, yes, this horse has a fine back.

179
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:28,474
I bought him in Italy.

180
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,643
They were happy to get rid of him.

181
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:34,397
He was such a wild horse.

182
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:38,859
No one could tame the beast,
but I told them...

183
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,195
such a headstrong horse...

184
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:46,196
is a perfect match for me.

185
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:52,540
Come dine with me tonight.
I feel like having a drink.

186
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:57,541
I think that can be arranged.

187
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,846
How did you manage to get
the Johnnie Walker?

188
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:11,847
I drank some already.

189
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:17,898
I'm sorry. This is all we have.

190
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:22,899
That's fine, as long as we have this.

191
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:27,324
What is this empty plate?

192
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:31,996
I have told our cook that all officers will
have the same rations and food as our men.

193
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:36,125
I'm sorry, but serving three dishes
is regulation.

194
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:40,004
Oh, but of course we have the right to be
served more than three dishes per meal.

195
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:45,005
You're absolutely right.

196
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,602
When you think about it...

197
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:59,603
it is regrettable that most of the
Combined Fleet was destroyed.

198
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,401
We still have some battleships left...

199
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:07,402
but we have very little striking power
from the air or sea.

200
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:13,370
Nishi, what do you mean?

201
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:18,371
So you have not heard about
the Mariana battle?

202
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:24,085
Admiral Ozawa's carrier and boat planes
were destroyed.

203
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:28,719
The Imperial headquarters...

204
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,014
is deceiving not just the people,
but us as well.

205
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:36,477
If you want my honest opinion, General...

206
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:39,230
the best thing to do...

207
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:44,231
would be to sink the island
to the bottom of the sea.

208
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:51,238
And yet, you still came?

209
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:52,785
Well...

210
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:57,786
I figured your men were going to need
all the tanks that I could bring.

211
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:48,632
This must be it.

212
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:53,633
Yes, the enemy must land here.

213
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:58,183
Run!

214
00:23:58,184 --> 00:24:00,019
Like you were one of the Americans!

215
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,020
Go on! Which direction would you take?

216
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:33,177
Hey...

217
00:24:33,178 --> 00:24:38,178
I think your general has gone mad.

218
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:44,225
Look at the gun he has.

219
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:49,693
He probably took it
from a dead American.

220
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:54,694
Maybe.

221
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:01,246
Break time is over.

222
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:06,247
Back to work!

223
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,463
Are you all right, Kashiwara?

224
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:12,883
You look pale.

225
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:15,678
I'm fine. It's just the damn water.

226
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,679
But...l...really...need to go.

227
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,787
There will be a major change
in our strategy.

228
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:46,788
We will dig caves in the Motoyama,
Higashiyama, and Suribachi-yama areas.

229
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:51,755
We will build these underground
fortifications, and fight to the end.

230
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:56,427
- What about the beach defenses, sir?
- Not needed.

231
00:25:56,428 --> 00:26:00,305
But, sir, the beach trenches
are our first line of defense.

232
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:03,851
Without the beach trenches,
how do you expect us to win?

233
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:08,852
Hayashi, do you know how many oars
America produces in a year?

234
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,649
Five million.

235
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,902
The Americans' technological advancements
cannot be underestimated.

236
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:18,282
They will cross the beaches eventually.

237
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:20,951
If we waste our soldiers there,
there is no hope for victory.

238
00:26:20,952 --> 00:26:23,328
It is inevitable that men will die...

239
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:26,749
but I never heard of an island operation
without beach fortifications.

240
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,544
General, it will be a futile waste of time
to start digging tunnels now.

241
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:32,337
We should force the enemy
near the island...

242
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:34,673
and launch a pincer drive
from the sea and air.

243
00:26:34,674 --> 00:26:37,259
I agree. That makes the most sense.

244
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,386
Ohsugi...

245
00:26:39,387 --> 00:26:44,387
doesn't the Navy know?

246
00:26:45,143 --> 00:26:48,854
The Combined Fleet has been completely
destroyed off the Marianas.

247
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:53,855
The island is now isolated.

248
00:26:56,488 --> 00:27:00,574
What's more, I received a new order from
the Imperial headquarters this morning.

249
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:04,953
The remaining fighter planes are to be
sent back to Tokyo to defend the mainland.

250
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:09,954
Outrageous! How are we to fight?

251
00:27:11,753 --> 00:27:16,753
We do not have time for discussion.
We should head back.

252
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:51,458
<i>Dear Mother...</i>

253
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:56,459
<i>I have been commissioned
to a new troop today.</i>

254
00:27:56,464 --> 00:28:01,464
<i>I cannot talk about this transfer now.</i>

255
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:06,469
<i>Take good care of yourself.</i>

256
00:28:17,443 --> 00:28:22,030
Look at this picture.

257
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:25,033
That's some fancy castle.

258
00:28:25,034 --> 00:28:28,537
You know who this castle was built for?

259
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:32,374
Someone who was already dead.

260
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:35,419
They must have had
a lot of money back then...

261
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,173
to build a castle like that
for a dead person.

262
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:41,967
Why are you reading that book anyway?

263
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:45,888
We're never going to war over there.

264
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:49,683
We'll be lucky if we even get
a hole in the ground when we're dead.

265
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:54,684
Don't talk about that. It's bad luck.

266
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:59,484
Is this the 312th?

267
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:01,778
That's right.

268
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:06,779
I'm Nozaki. This is Saigo.

269
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:11,993
Shimizu, you can put your bedroll there.

270
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:17,669
There's an empty space in the back.

271
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,172
Don't mind him.

272
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:24,509
His friend Kashiwara just died.

273
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:29,510
That used to be his spot.

274
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:36,688
But we are all going to die.

275
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:40,943
That's the plan, isn't it?

276
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:45,239
For our country, it is an honor.

277
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,992
Kashiwara died of honorable dysentery.

278
00:29:48,993 --> 00:29:53,993
Shimizu, where are you from?

279
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:56,959
Kanagawa-ken.

280
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,045
Ozawa is from there, aren't you?

281
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:05,046
That's right.

282
00:30:05,343 --> 00:30:07,719
Where were you trained?

283
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,723
Maybe we were at the same school?

284
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:13,517
No.

285
00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:16,103
I trained in Tokyo.

286
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:21,104
I trained in Tokyo, too. Where?

287
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:30,863
<i>The Koho Kimmu Yoin Yoseijo.</i>

288
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:42,546
Hey...

289
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:45,007
why do you think they put
a <i>Kempeitai</i> in our unit?

290
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:50,008
I don't know.

291
00:30:50,722 --> 00:30:55,684
He's not wearing the white armband.
He's not <i>Kempeitai.</i>

292
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:58,937
He went to the <i>Kempeitai</i>
military academy.

293
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:03,938
Maybe he was kicked out.

294
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:09,610
<i>He acts like</i> a <i>Kempeitai.</i>

295
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:15,996
Look at his holster.
That's not standard issue.

296
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:20,997
He's been put here to spy on us.

297
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:25,422
Why would he spy on us?

298
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:30,423
Maybe it's those letters
you've been writing.

299
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:36,387
You should be careful.

300
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:03,794
Weed soup again?

301
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:08,173
Kuribayashi is conserving
our food supplies for the battle.

302
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:13,174
We'll be dead
before the Americans even get here.

303
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:17,140
And you would think that with all my
war effort contributions...

304
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:22,141
we should be eating kasutera cakes
or sandwiches.

305
00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:24,064
What?

306
00:32:24,065 --> 00:32:29,065
I ran a bakery in Ohmiya with my wife.

307
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:33,031
Back when we could still get sugar...

308
00:32:33,032 --> 00:32:38,032
we sold ampan and kasutera cakes.

309
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:50,507
However, his <i>Kempeitai</i> brethren...

310
00:32:50,508 --> 00:32:55,508
used to come and take
whatever they wanted.

311
00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:59,808
For the war...

312
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:04,062
For the country...

313
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:08,817
Why bread?

314
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:13,818
We ran into those types
at our clothing store as well.

315
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:20,245
When we started making sandwiches...

316
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:24,541
they took those, too.

317
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:29,542
And when we ran out of meat
and just had bread, they still came.

318
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:38,301
Eventually, they took all of our
baking equipment for the metal...

319
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:45,308
and we were out of business.

320
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:52,356
I should have been a fisherman.

321
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:57,528
It must have been hard on your wife...

322
00:33:57,617 --> 00:34:02,617
without the shop
and without her husband.

323
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:38,861
Tell them to go away.
We have nothing to sell.

324
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:48,871
Congratulations! Your husband
is going to war.

325
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:04,808
Thank you very much.

326
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:09,809
I'm happy to serve the country.

327
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:16,820
Prayers for your eternal success at arms.

328
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:21,821
I beg of you! We have only each other.

329
00:35:24,996 --> 00:35:29,541
This is not the time.

330
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:34,542
We have all sent our husbands
and sons to war.

331
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:40,047
We all have to do our part.

332
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:48,097
At least you'll have a little one
to carry on your name.

333
00:35:59,196 --> 00:36:04,196
I can't eat with you like that.

334
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:09,744
What am I going to do after you die?

335
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:20,421
I'm not in the coffin yet.

336
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:25,468
The men never come home,
not even a soul.

337
00:36:27,016 --> 00:36:30,935
They'll never let you come home.

338
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:34,856
Don't worry.

339
00:36:34,857 --> 00:36:39,857
And now, with the baby.

340
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:03,218
Can you hear me?

341
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:07,472
It's Dad.

342
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:11,518
Listen.

343
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,519
Don't tell anyone
what I'm telling you now.

344
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:22,525
It's a secret.

345
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:38,916
Your dad...

346
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:43,963
is going to come home for you.

347
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:41,900
Hurry UP!

348
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:46,901
The enemy approaches!

349
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:56,122
This is ridiculous!

350
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:59,083
Why waste time digging these tunnels?

351
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:01,753
They are all going to die anyway.

352
00:39:01,754 --> 00:39:06,754
At least he conceded
to the pillboxes on the beach.

353
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,147
You wanted to see me, sir?

354
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:26,148
Care for a drink?

355
00:39:28,155 --> 00:39:33,155
You have been looking
quite pale these days.

356
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:38,206
It's the water. It has
never agreed with me.

357
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:40,959
That's not good.

358
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,588
Why don't you go back
to the mainland to recoup?

359
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:50,589
I have commissioned Admiral lchimaru
to take your place.

360
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,472
We are wasting time
digging these tunnels.

361
00:39:54,473 --> 00:39:59,473
General, the island won't last
five days without fleet support.

362
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:03,982
We should fight to the death.

363
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:08,983
The tunnel-digging may be futile.

364
00:40:09,113 --> 00:40:13,491
Maybe the stand on lwo will be futile.

365
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:15,869
Maybe the whole war is futile.

366
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,871
But will you give up then?

367
00:40:17,872 --> 00:40:20,164
We will defend this island
until we are dead!

368
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:23,251
Until the very last soldier is dead!

369
00:40:23,252 --> 00:40:27,839
If our children can live safely
for one more day...

370
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,885
it would be worth the one more day
that we defend this island!

371
00:40:31,886 --> 00:40:33,678
Ohsugi...

372
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:38,558
if you have an ounce
of pride left as an officer...

373
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,518
I beg of you...

374
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:45,519
go back to headquarters
and ask them to send support.

375
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,380
So the rumor is true?
I couldn't believe it.

376
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,510
I'm grateful to be leaving this island.

377
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:22,268
We may have had our differences...

378
00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:26,648
but I'm truly sorry to see you go.

379
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:31,402
General Hayashi, it is up to you now.

380
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:36,403
Kuribayashi belongs behind a desk,
not commanding war.

381
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:38,743
I understand.

382
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:43,744
There are many of us
who agree with you, sir.

383
00:41:57,388 --> 00:41:58,888
Listen.

384
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:03,889
The Americans are likely to land here.

385
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:07,689
Crossfire positions will be here...

386
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,816
here...

387
00:42:09,817 --> 00:42:12,402
and here.

388
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:13,861
The fact is...

389
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:18,862
we are completely
outnumbered in every sector.

390
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:24,956
But we have a great advantage.

391
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:29,957
Can anyone tell me what that is?

392
00:42:33,132 --> 00:42:36,300
The Americans are weak-willed
and inferior to Japanese soldiers.

393
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:38,678
Very good, Shimizu.

394
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,471
Why is that?

395
00:42:40,472 --> 00:42:42,223
They are not as disciplined...

396
00:42:42,224 --> 00:42:45,101
and they let their emotions
interfere with their duty.

397
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:50,064
That is correct.

398
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:54,527
Here is the uniform
of an American medic.

399
00:42:54,528 --> 00:42:56,612
He should be your target.

400
00:42:56,613 --> 00:43:01,613
For Americans will risk the lives
of many soldiers to save this one.

401
00:43:01,618 --> 00:43:06,618
Understood?

402
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:19,256
General, may I speak with you?

403
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:24,265
Please keep an eye on
Major General Hayashi.

404
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,809
Thank you for your concern, Nishi...

405
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,188
but we don't have any time to waste.

406
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:35,189
We must think about what
we can do at this moment.

407
00:43:36,737 --> 00:43:41,365
Admiral lchimaru.

408
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:44,243
Reporting for duty, sir.

409
00:43:44,244 --> 00:43:46,287
Excuse me.

410
00:43:46,288 --> 00:43:51,288
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

411
00:45:47,326 --> 00:45:51,329
Jupiter!

412
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:56,330
Jupiter.

413
00:46:43,882 --> 00:46:46,133
Yamazaki...

414
00:46:46,134 --> 00:46:51,134
what are you doing just
sitting there? Help us--

415
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:33,264
I think he's writing about us
in his reports.

416
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:35,433
He's just writing a letter.

417
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:39,770
It's been two months, Nozaki.

418
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:41,731
He would have reported us by now.

419
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:46,732
How can you be sure?

420
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:54,744
Will they ever stop?

421
00:47:54,745 --> 00:47:59,745
Day and night, day and night...

422
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:02,960
It's driving me crazy!

423
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:07,961
If the damn Americans
are going to invade...

424
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:14,217
why don't they hurry up and land?

425
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,485
<i>Take-Chan...</i>

426
00:48:27,486 --> 00:48:31,947
<i>the four chicks that were born
two months ago have grown so much.</i>

427
00:48:31,948 --> 00:48:36,494
<i>The mother chicken leads them
for food every day...</i>

428
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:41,495
<i>but they're giving me</i> a <i>hard time, picking
at the vegetable garden I have grown.</i>

429
00:48:45,629 --> 00:48:50,629
The fleet of American ships
has left Saipan.

430
00:48:57,391 --> 00:49:00,684
So they are on their way.

431
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:05,685
Ready the troops.

432
00:49:38,223 --> 00:49:40,724
Men...

433
00:49:40,725 --> 00:49:44,687
the time has come
to show your true colors.

434
00:49:44,688 --> 00:49:47,773
As a member of the honorable
Imperial Army...

435
00:49:47,774 --> 00:49:52,774
I trust that you will fight with honor.

436
00:49:53,488 --> 00:49:58,488
This island is of utmost importance
to Japan.

437
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:02,413
<i>Should the island fall...</i>

438
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:04,999
the enemy...

439
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
will use it as their base
to attack our homeland.

440
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:13,549
For the mainland...

441
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,676
For our homeland...

442
00:50:15,677 --> 00:50:18,971
Until the very last man.

443
00:50:18,972 --> 00:50:23,559
<i>Our duty is to stop the enemy right here.</i>

444
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,644
<i>Not one of you...</i>

445
00:50:25,645 --> 00:50:30,645
is allowed to die until you have killed
10 enemy soldiers.

446
00:50:32,903 --> 00:50:37,903
Do not expect to return home alive.

447
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:44,034
I will always be in front of you.

448
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:57,005
Long live the Emperor.

449
00:51:37,759 --> 00:51:42,596
<i>Take care and be well.</i>

450
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:47,597
<i>I will fight courageously until the end,
in the spirit of Yamato.</i>

451
00:51:48,895 --> 00:51:53,895
<i>My heart will always be with you.</i>

452
00:51:54,317 --> 00:51:59,317
<i>Takeichi.</i>

453
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,960
<i>Every household is assigned a quota
of bag-making for the gunpowder.</i>

454
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:23,133
<i>I cannot help but get tense when I think
that these will be used in battle.</i>

455
00:52:23,471 --> 00:52:27,349
<i>Taro and Yoko laugh at me for this.</i>

456
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,520
<i>Takako, on evacuation in Nagano,
is also doing well.</i>

457
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:34,648
<i>I pray for your safety.</i>

458
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:39,649
<i>Sincerely, Yoshi.</i>

459
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:55,957
No one can shoot me now.

460
00:52:56,671 --> 00:53:01,671
That's a nice belt.
My wife sent me one, too.

461
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:10,184
Doesn't look like Mr. Kempeitai
has a thousand-stitch belt, does he?

462
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:12,853
Maybe he thinks it will clash
with his uniform.

463
00:53:12,854 --> 00:53:17,854
He probably doesn't believe
in superstitions, anyway.

464
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:25,362
His mother made him one after all.

465
00:53:45,762 --> 00:53:49,181
- Maybe they're trying to sink the island.
- My head hurts.

466
00:53:49,182 --> 00:53:52,351
How many ships do you think
there are out there?

467
00:53:52,352 --> 00:53:56,397
At least 30. Maybe even 50.

468
00:53:56,398 --> 00:53:59,149
- They must be really close.
- I need to take a leak.

469
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:02,069
Don't go near the sewers.
Dysentery is spreading through there.

470
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,570
Where do I go then?

471
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:08,571
There is a pot at the end of the cave.

472
00:54:25,927 --> 00:54:28,095
The shit pot is full.

473
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:33,096
Someone needs to throw it out.

474
00:54:53,621 --> 00:54:57,458
If anything happens to that pot...

475
00:54:57,459 --> 00:55:02,459
you'll be carrying our shit away
with your hands.

476
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:12,241
Is this some kind of a joke?

477
00:56:12,242 --> 00:56:17,242
Why are you always picking on me?

478
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,700
Thank you, God. I take back
what I said before.

479
00:57:12,886 --> 00:57:15,095
Shall we commence fire?

480
00:57:15,096 --> 00:57:20,096
Not yet.

481
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:26,311
The men wish to commence firing.

482
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:36,074
Hold your fire!

483
00:57:36,075 --> 00:57:37,743
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

484
00:57:37,744 --> 00:57:42,744
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

485
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:50,339
They will take the beach
in no time if we do not resist.

486
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,340
Wait until the beach is full.

487
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:20,031
Let's go. Commence firing!

488
00:58:23,873 --> 00:58:26,416
Commence firing!

489
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:31,417
<i>Commence firing!</i>

490
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:32,190
The guns of the Kitakubo unit
were destroyed.

491
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:34,693
All the pillbox units on the beach
have been destroyed.

492
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:36,778
However, all other forces are intact...

493
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:39,531
and we estimate more than
1,000 enemy casualties.

494
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:42,325
The pillbox destruction was unavoidable.

495
00:59:42,326 --> 00:59:44,703
Overall, that is good news.

496
00:59:44,704 --> 00:59:47,706
How are the men
holding up at Suribachi?

497
00:59:47,707 --> 00:59:52,707
Forces are intact.

498
00:59:52,837 --> 00:59:54,421
What is the enemy situation?

499
00:59:54,422 --> 00:59:57,799
Approximately 20,000 men and 80 tanks.

500
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,262
There has to be more than that.
They still have men waiting in the boats.

501
01:00:02,263 --> 01:00:05,223
Currently the enemy front extends...

502
01:00:05,224 --> 01:00:08,477
between Suribachi
and the south landing...

503
01:00:08,478 --> 01:00:11,396
and Chidori airfield south.

504
01:00:11,397 --> 01:00:16,397
Just as I thought... Suribachi
and the Motoyama airfield.

505
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:21,569
They are making a two-pronged attack.

506
01:00:34,212 --> 01:00:39,212
That's not enough! I need more ammo.

507
01:01:02,615 --> 01:01:04,366
Take his place!

508
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:09,079
- The machine gun is blasted.
- Use your rifle!

509
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,706
Watch out! imbecile!

510
01:01:11,707 --> 01:01:13,083
I can't rely on you.

511
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:16,711
Go send a report to Colonel Adachi
that we need another machine gun.

512
01:01:16,712 --> 01:01:21,712
Hurry UP!

513
01:01:44,407 --> 01:01:47,033
Colonel Adaohi is asking
for reinforcements.

514
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:52,034
We can't afford to send reinforcements.
Tell him to hold out.

515
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:07,717
Shoot him!

516
01:02:12,018 --> 01:02:17,018
- What's the matter?
- We're out of bullets!

517
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,874
We are losing Suribachi.

518
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:40,712
All is lost. Request permission
to lead a suicide mission.

519
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:44,466
No. You must try to hold them off.

520
01:02:44,467 --> 01:02:49,095
Do what you can to survive
and join forces in the north caves.

521
01:02:49,096 --> 01:02:50,889
But, sir...

522
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:54,059
I have failed to hold Suribachi.

523
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,312
Permit me to die with honor
with my men.

524
01:02:57,313 --> 01:02:59,147
No, Colonel.

525
01:02:59,148 --> 01:03:04,148
<i>This is an order!</i>

526
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:09,241
Adachi.

527
01:03:09,242 --> 01:03:14,242
Adachi!

528
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:28,339
Sir, Captain Tanida
requests machine guns.

529
01:03:29,512 --> 01:03:34,512
It's over.

530
01:03:38,938 --> 01:03:41,523
Suicide...

531
01:03:41,524 --> 01:03:44,401
That's the only thing left.

532
01:03:44,402 --> 01:03:46,736
But--

533
01:03:46,737 --> 01:03:51,737
Here, take this to your commander.

534
01:04:34,702 --> 01:04:38,496
I heard General Kuribayashi
order Colonel Adachi to escape.

535
01:04:38,497 --> 01:04:43,084
Quiet!

536
01:04:43,085 --> 01:04:47,505
Escape is the coward's way.

537
01:04:47,506 --> 01:04:52,506
Sit down!

538
01:05:00,895 --> 01:05:04,856
Men...

539
01:05:04,857 --> 01:05:08,777
we are...

540
01:05:08,778 --> 01:05:13,778
honorable soldiers of the Emperor.

541
01:05:14,825 --> 01:05:19,825
Don't ever forget that.

542
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:24,376
The only way left for us...

543
01:05:24,377 --> 01:05:29,377
is to die with honor.

544
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:33,218
This is our fate...

545
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:38,219
to find our place at Yasukuni Shrine.

546
01:05:40,643 --> 01:05:45,643
I'll see you there.

547
01:06:02,081 --> 01:06:07,081
Soldiers, farewell!

548
01:07:59,365 --> 01:08:04,365
Stop!

549
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,502
You should die like an honorable soldier.

550
01:08:12,503 --> 01:08:16,798
Look, Shimizu...

551
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:20,552
we can still join the troops
in the northern caves.

552
01:08:20,553 --> 01:08:23,388
Our orders are to stay here until death.

553
01:08:23,389 --> 01:08:26,349
I heard General Kuribayashi himself.

554
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:29,852
That's what he said...

555
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:32,647
over the radio.

556
01:08:32,648 --> 01:08:37,648
It's true.

557
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:41,864
We can die here...

558
01:08:41,865 --> 01:08:46,865
or we can continue fighting.

559
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:52,830
Which would better serve the Emperor?

560
01:08:53,586 --> 01:08:58,586
Which one?

561
01:09:17,276 --> 01:09:18,818
Where does this go?

562
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:23,819
It will take us closer to Motoyama.

563
01:09:27,202 --> 01:09:30,455
Do you have orders to move back?

564
01:09:30,456 --> 01:09:32,915
Where are the rest of your men?

565
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:35,793
All dead.

566
01:09:35,794 --> 01:09:40,794
It's the same with us.

567
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,139
There should be an outlet
somewhere near here.

568
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:53,140
Be quiet!

569
01:10:37,022 --> 01:10:42,022
So you thought you could blow us up,
or burn us alive, did you?

570
01:10:57,543 --> 01:11:00,044
- Have we heard from Suribachi?
- No, sir.

571
01:11:00,045 --> 01:11:05,045
Send a messenger!

572
01:11:09,596 --> 01:11:14,596
Lieutenant Oiso has ordered us
to rendezvous at the east cave.

573
01:11:21,734 --> 01:11:25,403
We will make a run for Motoyama.

574
01:11:25,404 --> 01:11:28,781
There is no cover for two kilometers.

575
01:11:28,782 --> 01:11:33,782
It will be every man for himself.

576
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:40,585
See you on the other side.

577
01:11:40,586 --> 01:11:45,586
If not on this earth,
then in the next world.

578
01:11:59,354 --> 01:12:02,190
Don't run with the herd.
That's where the enemy will fire.

579
01:12:02,191 --> 01:12:04,192
Stay back.

580
01:12:04,193 --> 01:12:07,528
That's cowardice!

581
01:12:07,529 --> 01:12:12,529
There is no use for a dead soldier.

582
01:12:40,979 --> 01:12:45,979
Wait until the flare is gone.

583
01:13:09,258 --> 01:13:14,258
Crawl forward.

584
01:13:29,486 --> 01:13:31,279
What happened to the messenger?

585
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,280
He never came back.

586
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,536
I will go to Adachi myself.

587
01:13:38,537 --> 01:13:42,915
Motoyama's transmitter
still works, General.

588
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:47,916
Why not try there, sir?

589
01:14:05,898 --> 01:14:10,898
Sir, these men retreated
from Mt. Suribachi.

590
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,657
What are your names?

591
01:14:16,658 --> 01:14:19,827
Saigo, from the 312th.

592
01:14:19,828 --> 01:14:23,539
Shimizu, reporting for duty.

593
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:28,540
You escaped from Suribachi?

594
01:14:32,007 --> 01:14:35,968
How dare you!

595
01:14:35,969 --> 01:14:40,969
It was your duty
to stay in your position until death.

596
01:14:41,183 --> 01:14:43,684
You should have died...

597
01:14:43,685 --> 01:14:47,271
with your fellow troop members.

598
01:14:47,272 --> 01:14:52,272
You are both a disgrace.

599
01:14:55,238 --> 01:14:59,367
Get on your knees.

600
01:14:59,368 --> 01:15:04,368
- But, sir--
- I said, get on your knees!

601
01:15:22,307 --> 01:15:26,435
I don't want you to kill
my soldiers needlessly.

602
01:15:26,436 --> 01:15:28,521
Put down your sword.

603
01:15:28,522 --> 01:15:33,522
Put it down!

604
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:40,116
What's going on here?

605
01:15:40,117 --> 01:15:45,117
These men ran from Suribachi.

606
01:15:46,832 --> 01:15:51,832
Lt. Ito, I gave the order that all survivors
retreat to the north caves.

607
01:15:54,006 --> 01:15:57,925
I am very sorry, General.

608
01:15:57,926 --> 01:16:00,469
It's just...

609
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:04,306
Suribachi...

610
01:16:04,307 --> 01:16:09,307
has fallen.

611
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:28,873
Now that Suribachi has been taken...

612
01:16:28,874 --> 01:16:31,459
the enemy will maneuver all forces
onto the hillside.

613
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:36,460
We must move
our command center north, sir.

614
01:16:39,843 --> 01:16:43,137
Ito...

615
01:16:43,138 --> 01:16:47,141
fight for your fallen brethren...

616
01:16:47,142 --> 01:16:52,142
until the end.

617
01:17:11,374 --> 01:17:16,374
Get up!

618
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:19,340
Major General Hayashi
is leading an attack.

619
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:24,341
We are to join him.

620
01:17:24,513 --> 01:17:29,391
Kuribayashi's orders are
to remain in the caves.

621
01:17:29,392 --> 01:17:34,392
Lieutenant Ito says Kuribayashi
is a weak American sympathizer.

622
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:48,615
We will take back Mt. Suribachi.

623
01:18:08,557 --> 01:18:13,185
Where is Major General Hayashi?

624
01:18:13,186 --> 01:18:15,187
We don't know, sir.

625
01:18:15,188 --> 01:18:16,856
Who is in charge here?

626
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:21,857
I'm not sure.

627
01:18:21,903 --> 01:18:26,903
Stay here until
I determine the plan of action.

628
01:18:50,015 --> 01:18:55,015
We're dead.

629
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,149
Pull back!

630
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:05,150
We'll get reinforcements.

631
01:19:34,309 --> 01:19:39,309
Why didn't your regiment join the attack?

632
01:19:43,193 --> 01:19:45,778
Don't sit here like rats!

633
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:50,779
Come out of your caves and fight!

634
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:52,910
Where is your commander?

635
01:19:52,911 --> 01:19:57,911
We haven't received the order to attack.

636
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:02,628
Didn't you receive the order
from General Hayashi?

637
01:20:02,629 --> 01:20:06,257
Kuribayashi countermanded
Hayashi's order.

638
01:20:06,258 --> 01:20:11,258
There is to be no attack.

639
01:20:11,846 --> 01:20:14,974
We will take back Suribachi...

640
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:17,309
with or without Kuribayashi.

641
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:20,688
There are already troops on the attack.
Get your men in order.

642
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:23,524
Lieutenant, may I remind you
of your rank!

643
01:20:23,525 --> 01:20:26,735
Your disrespect for senior officers...

644
01:20:26,736 --> 01:20:31,573
puts your men at needless risk.

645
01:20:31,574 --> 01:20:33,742
I suggest you go back to your cave...

646
01:20:33,743 --> 01:20:38,743
or hand over your men.

647
01:20:47,841 --> 01:20:49,466
Enough.

648
01:20:49,467 --> 01:20:54,467
We'll do it ourselves.

649
01:21:02,314 --> 01:21:04,023
That's against regulations.

650
01:21:04,024 --> 01:21:09,024
That's the officer who tried to kill us.
He doesn't care.

651
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:43,187
I won't go back.

652
01:21:43,188 --> 01:21:47,608
I've had enough of cave fighting.

653
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:52,609
You men are now under
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi's command.

654
01:22:02,582 --> 01:22:07,582
I will throw myself under an enemy tank.

655
01:22:08,046 --> 01:22:13,046
I will take out one of their machines.

656
01:22:39,202 --> 01:22:42,830
Hurry.

657
01:22:42,831 --> 01:22:46,041
What is the status?

658
01:22:46,042 --> 01:22:47,960
A thousand men were lost...

659
01:22:47,961 --> 01:22:50,003
in a night attack along Chidori airfield.

660
01:22:50,004 --> 01:22:52,965
Why? I have given them strict orders
not to kill themselves.

661
01:22:52,966 --> 01:22:57,594
It seems that the order to retreat
was not conveyed to all sectors.

662
01:22:57,595 --> 01:22:59,346
Hayashi.

663
01:22:59,347 --> 01:23:01,765
Damn you!

664
01:23:01,766 --> 01:23:03,851
And the American advancement?

665
01:23:03,852 --> 01:23:07,813
A battalion is headed north and we
are fighting back along the west ridge.

666
01:23:07,814 --> 01:23:12,814
Good. Once they cross the west ridge,
they will be surrounded on three sides.

667
01:23:13,486 --> 01:23:14,945
This just arrived.

668
01:23:14,946 --> 01:23:19,946
Read it.

669
01:23:21,035 --> 01:23:24,746
From headquarters...

670
01:23:24,747 --> 01:23:29,747
"We regret that we are unable to send
reinforcements to lwo at this time.

671
01:23:30,837 --> 01:23:35,090
We earnestly hope you will
fight honorably...

672
01:23:35,091 --> 01:23:40,091
and die for your country."

673
01:25:19,362 --> 01:25:24,362
Bring him in.

674
01:25:36,296 --> 01:25:41,296
Bring him in.

675
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:50,642
Shall I finish him off?

676
01:25:50,643 --> 01:25:54,062
No. Treat him.

677
01:25:54,063 --> 01:25:55,480
But, sir--

678
01:25:55,481 --> 01:25:58,275
Okubo, you would expect the same,
wouldn't you?

679
01:25:58,276 --> 01:25:59,985
Endo, treat him.

680
01:25:59,986 --> 01:26:04,239
We are low on morphine as it is.

681
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,242
Sir, the Americans would not treat
a wounded Japanese soldier.

682
01:26:07,243 --> 01:26:11,747
Son, have you ever met one?

683
01:26:11,748 --> 01:26:16,748
Treat him.

684
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:53,538
Where are you, American tanks?

685
01:26:53,539 --> 01:26:58,539
Come and get me!

686
01:27:10,807 --> 01:27:12,933
How is the prisoner doing?

687
01:27:12,934 --> 01:27:17,934
He is awake, sir.

688
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:23,231
I will question the prisoner
for information.

689
01:29:07,924 --> 01:29:11,551
Damn.

690
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:13,762
I've had enough of this.

691
01:29:13,763 --> 01:29:18,763
I'm going to surrender.

692
01:29:20,061 --> 01:29:23,230
Go ahead and arrest me.

693
01:29:23,231 --> 01:29:28,231
I don't care anymore. That's what
you were put here for, isn't it?

694
01:29:28,402 --> 01:29:33,402
To report treasonous thoughts.

695
01:29:35,368 --> 01:29:38,620
I was put here because...

696
01:29:38,621 --> 01:29:43,621
I was discharged from the <i>Kempeitai.</i>

697
01:29:44,001 --> 01:29:49,001
Discharged?

698
01:29:49,799 --> 01:29:54,799
I had only been in service
for five days.

699
01:29:56,347 --> 01:29:57,597
Shimizu...

700
01:29:57,598 --> 01:30:01,476
you must always be firm.

701
01:30:01,477 --> 01:30:06,477
Any mercy and people
will take advantage of you.

702
01:30:11,195 --> 01:30:12,654
That's unpatriotic.

703
01:30:12,655 --> 01:30:17,655
Go sort it out, Shimizu.

704
01:30:26,878 --> 01:30:29,880
You do not have the Imperial ﬂag
properly displayed.

705
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:31,298
I'm sorry.

706
01:30:31,299 --> 01:30:34,968
My husband has gone to war
and I couldn't put it up myself.

707
01:30:34,969 --> 01:30:37,846
It is unpatriotic
not to have the ﬂag displayed.

708
01:30:37,847 --> 01:30:42,847
If you help me, I'll put it up now.

709
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:04,164
Get that dog to shut up.

710
01:31:04,165 --> 01:31:06,499
What was that, sir?

711
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:11,338
That dog is a nuisance.
It is disruptive of Army communications.

712
01:31:11,339 --> 01:31:16,339
I am very sorry, sir.

713
01:31:19,764 --> 01:31:23,183
Shimizu. Dispose of the dog.

714
01:31:23,184 --> 01:31:28,184
We can't have a dog interfering
with important military commands.

715
01:31:32,526 --> 01:31:34,486
Take the dog in the back.

716
01:31:34,487 --> 01:31:36,071
It's only a dog.

717
01:31:36,072 --> 01:31:39,115
It won't happen again.

718
01:31:39,116 --> 01:31:41,034
Take it out back.

719
01:31:41,035 --> 01:31:43,870
Keep the children inside.

720
01:31:43,871 --> 01:31:48,871
Hurry UP-

721
01:32:33,421 --> 01:32:36,464
Take the dog into the house
and keep him quiet...

722
01:32:36,465 --> 01:32:41,465
and never let him out.

723
01:32:49,645 --> 01:32:54,645
It's taken care of, sir.

724
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,313
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

725
01:33:33,314 --> 01:33:38,314
If you can't even shoot a dog,
you'll never be able to handle the Reds.

726
01:33:40,404 --> 01:33:45,404
You are unpatriotic!

727
01:33:48,037 --> 01:33:51,623
I was discharged for insubordination...

728
01:33:51,624 --> 01:33:56,624
and sent here.

729
01:34:02,134 --> 01:34:05,428
Don't look so glum, Shimizu.

730
01:34:05,429 --> 01:34:10,429
At least now only the enemy hates you.

731
01:34:13,187 --> 01:34:18,187
I don't blame the dog.

732
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:42,298
<i>Taro...</i>

733
01:34:42,299 --> 01:34:45,844
<i>tonight I attended my farewell party.</i>

734
01:34:45,845 --> 01:34:48,555
<i>The wives also attended,
so there was a lot of fuss.</i>

735
01:34:48,556 --> 01:34:51,724
<i>Greeting all the ladies...</i>

736
01:34:51,725 --> 01:34:56,725
<i>kept me from enjoying the food.</i>

737
01:37:39,935 --> 01:37:42,770
ls there any information
of the enemy's plan?

738
01:37:42,771 --> 01:37:46,858
No, it's just a letter.

739
01:37:46,859 --> 01:37:51,112
It's from his mother.

740
01:37:51,113 --> 01:37:53,239
"Sam...

741
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:56,200
I have mailed you
a couple of books to read.

742
01:37:56,201 --> 01:37:59,120
I hope that you like them.

743
01:37:59,121 --> 01:38:00,872
Yesterday...

744
01:38:00,873 --> 01:38:05,873
the dogs dug a hole under the fence.

745
01:38:07,004 --> 01:38:12,004
They ran all over the neighborhood.

746
01:38:12,343 --> 01:38:15,762
By the time we found them...

747
01:38:15,763 --> 01:38:20,763
the Harrisons' roosters were terrorized.

748
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:25,646
Don't worry about us.

749
01:38:25,647 --> 01:38:30,109
Just take care of yourself
and come back safely.

750
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:35,110
Remember what I said to you...

751
01:38:37,451 --> 01:38:40,161
always do what is right...

752
01:38:40,162 --> 01:38:43,539
because it is right.

753
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:47,377
I pray for a speedy end to the war...

754
01:38:47,378 --> 01:38:50,380
and your safe return.

755
01:38:50,381 --> 01:38:55,381
Love, Mom."

756
01:39:26,375 --> 01:39:29,168
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more medicine.

757
01:39:29,169 --> 01:39:34,169
It's all right. I'm useless now.
Go help the others!

758
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:08,680
Okubo, come here.

759
01:41:12,439 --> 01:41:16,275
How are we on ammunition?

760
01:41:16,276 --> 01:41:20,238
Not good, sir.

761
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:22,990
Our mortars have been taken out...

762
01:41:22,991 --> 01:41:26,661
and we're out of machine gun ammo.

763
01:41:26,662 --> 01:41:31,662
We have only our rifles.

764
01:41:32,084 --> 01:41:33,251
Okubo...

765
01:41:33,252 --> 01:41:38,252
you are now in charge of the men.

766
01:41:41,802 --> 01:41:44,136
We can no longer hold this area.

767
01:41:44,137 --> 01:41:49,137
You must guide
the rest of the men north.

768
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:54,855
Take whatever food and ammo
we have left.

769
01:41:54,856 --> 01:41:59,856
What about you, sir?

770
01:42:00,654 --> 01:42:04,907
I'm tired of sharing this cave
with all of you.

771
01:42:04,908 --> 01:42:07,785
I'm a one-man show from here on out.

772
01:42:07,786 --> 01:42:10,913
What are you talking about, sir?

773
01:42:10,914 --> 01:42:15,251
Your first order of business...

774
01:42:15,252 --> 01:42:20,252
is to find some water.

775
01:42:43,989 --> 01:42:46,616
Men...

776
01:42:46,617 --> 01:42:49,744
do your best.

777
01:42:49,745 --> 01:42:54,745
Do what is right...

778
01:42:56,001 --> 01:43:00,421
because it is right.

779
01:43:00,422 --> 01:43:05,422
Understood?

780
01:43:09,473 --> 01:43:14,473
I will make sure that they send you
medicine and food.

781
01:43:16,688 --> 01:43:19,440
It has been a great honor...

782
01:43:19,441 --> 01:43:21,984
to serve...

783
01:43:21,985 --> 01:43:26,985
under you.

784
01:44:02,609 --> 01:44:07,609
Hand me my riﬂe.

785
01:44:27,968 --> 01:44:32,968
I'm sorry, Okubo.

786
01:45:49,966 --> 01:45:53,344
Why am I not getting any reports?
Have we heard from Admiral lchimaru?

787
01:45:53,345 --> 01:45:58,345
- No, sir.
- What about Nishi or Hayashi?

788
01:45:58,558 --> 01:46:01,852
- Send out messengers!
- We have. Many times.

789
01:46:01,853 --> 01:46:04,063
None of them have come back.

790
01:46:04,064 --> 01:46:09,064
You can't plan strategy like this!

791
01:46:17,035 --> 01:46:21,288
I have been thinking about
what Lt. Colonel Nishi said.

792
01:46:21,289 --> 01:46:26,289
He's right.

793
01:46:27,963 --> 01:46:31,632
I don't know anything about the enemy.

794
01:46:31,633 --> 01:46:36,633
I believed that the Americans
were cowards...

795
01:46:41,434 --> 01:46:46,434
but they weren't.

796
01:46:48,441 --> 01:46:52,278
I was taught...

797
01:46:52,279 --> 01:46:55,781
that they were savages...

798
01:46:55,782 --> 01:47:00,782
but that American soldier...

799
01:47:05,292 --> 01:47:10,292
his mother's words...

800
01:47:11,339 --> 01:47:14,675
were the same as my mother's.

801
01:47:14,676 --> 01:47:19,597
I want to fulfill my duty
for the general...

802
01:47:19,598 --> 01:47:23,475
and our country...

803
01:47:23,476 --> 01:47:28,476
but I don't want to die for nothing.

804
01:47:31,651 --> 01:47:36,651
What do you think?

805
01:47:45,206 --> 01:47:47,625
You...

806
01:47:47,626 --> 01:47:52,626
haven't lived enough to realize...

807
01:47:55,216 --> 01:48:00,216
what you are sacrificing.

808
01:48:06,019 --> 01:48:11,019
Will you surrender with me?

809
01:48:29,668 --> 01:48:34,588
Careful.

810
01:48:34,589 --> 01:48:39,385
They'll notice if we leave together.
You go first.

811
01:48:39,386 --> 01:48:41,303
I'll make up an excuse.

812
01:48:41,304 --> 01:48:44,098
After a while, I'll tell them
I'm going to check on you.

813
01:48:44,099 --> 01:48:49,099
We'll be gone before they even notice.

814
01:48:49,521 --> 01:48:52,398
Pretend that you have dysentery.

815
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:57,399
Give me your dysentery look.

816
01:49:04,577 --> 01:49:09,577
I guess that'll have to do.

817
01:49:15,213 --> 01:49:17,089
Where are you going?

818
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:19,216
I've got dysentery.

819
01:49:19,217 --> 01:49:21,301
You're going to surrender, aren't you?

820
01:49:21,302 --> 01:49:24,054
If you are, take me with you.

821
01:49:24,055 --> 01:49:29,055
- I've had enough of this war.
- Be quiet!

822
01:49:35,108 --> 01:49:37,860
Where are you going?

823
01:49:37,861 --> 01:49:40,487
He said he wasn't feeling well.
It could be dysentery.

824
01:49:40,488 --> 01:49:45,488
You two! Stop!

825
01:49:47,537 --> 01:49:52,537
Sir, maybe they got spooked.

826
01:50:06,139 --> 01:50:09,266
Miura, you're on guard.

827
01:50:09,267 --> 01:50:14,267
Make sure we have no more deserters.

828
01:51:37,564 --> 01:51:42,025
What unit were you with?

829
01:51:42,026 --> 01:51:47,026
Higashiyama 314th.

830
01:51:55,623 --> 01:51:58,750
Did you hear...

831
01:51:58,751 --> 01:52:03,751
I heard that they would give you a meal.

832
01:52:04,382 --> 01:52:09,382
A meal...

833
01:52:09,762 --> 01:52:14,762
That sounds good.

834
01:52:16,477 --> 01:52:21,477
I'm from Yokohama, too.

835
01:52:21,608 --> 01:52:26,608
After this is over, you can come visit me.

836
01:53:41,187 --> 01:53:46,187
Lieutenant!

837
01:54:24,063 --> 01:54:28,066
Let this be a lesson to anyone else...

838
01:54:28,067 --> 01:54:33,067
who wants to surrender.

839
01:55:42,642 --> 01:55:47,354
We need to get through the crossfire
to reach the north...

840
01:55:47,355 --> 01:55:52,355
and join our forces at the front.

841
01:55:55,113 --> 01:55:57,280
Listen.

842
01:55:57,281 --> 01:56:02,281
We'll head for that cave
and make our way from there.

843
01:56:03,329 --> 01:56:06,039
Don't waste a bullet!

844
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:08,041
Not a single one.

845
01:56:08,042 --> 01:56:13,042
Don't shoot recklessly.

846
01:57:10,271 --> 01:57:15,271
These are Nishi's troops
and the survivors from Suribachi.

847
01:57:18,446 --> 01:57:23,446
Are there no officers?

848
01:57:24,243 --> 01:57:27,579
You all did a good job making it here.

849
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:32,580
Fujita, water for them.

850
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:38,920
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more water.

851
01:57:40,635 --> 01:57:43,094
I'm sorry.

852
01:57:43,095 --> 01:57:48,095
At least you can rest.

853
01:57:59,612 --> 01:58:04,612
You look familiar.

854
01:58:06,452 --> 01:58:11,122
You almost lost your head.

855
01:58:11,123 --> 01:58:16,123
That was the second time you saved me.

856
01:58:17,964 --> 01:58:20,131
The first time...

857
01:58:20,132 --> 01:58:25,132
was the day you landed on the island.

858
01:58:27,515 --> 01:58:31,142
Of course. I remember.

859
01:58:31,143 --> 01:58:36,143
Well, everything happens in threes.

860
01:58:49,453 --> 01:58:51,830
Hanako...

861
01:58:51,831 --> 01:58:54,958
<i>This letter will probably
never get to you...</i>

862
01:58:54,959 --> 01:58:56,668
but...

863
01:58:56,669 --> 01:59:00,338
<i>it comforts me to write.</i>

864
01:59:00,339 --> 01:59:04,175
<i>For five days, we've been
without water and food.</i>

865
01:59:04,176 --> 01:59:07,721
<i>To survive...</i>

866
01:59:07,722 --> 01:59:12,722
<i>we do unspeakable things.</i>

867
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:15,395
<i>There is no escape now.</i>

868
01:59:15,396 --> 01:59:17,814
<i>But...</i>

869
01:59:17,815 --> 01:59:22,815
<i>my only concern is for you and the baby.</i>

870
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:32,199
Dig up some worms.

871
01:59:47,845 --> 01:59:51,097
<i>The battle is approaching its end...</i>

872
01:59:51,098 --> 01:59:54,017
<i>and there is no more ammunition,
no more water.</i>

873
01:59:54,018 --> 01:59:58,855
<i>All the survivors will engage
in a general attack.</i>

874
01:59:58,856 --> 02:00:02,901
<i>I pray for the victory
and safety of the Empire.</i>

875
02:00:02,902 --> 02:00:06,696
<i>I bid you farewell.</i>

876
02:00:06,697 --> 02:00:10,909
<i>For the country,
I could not fulfill all of my duties.</i>

877
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:15,910
<i>Now that we have no ammunition,
it is with regret that we must perish.</i>

878
02:00:21,379 --> 02:00:26,379
You made it all the way from Suribachi?

879
02:00:27,426 --> 02:00:32,426
That must have been quite a journey.

880
02:00:35,393 --> 02:00:39,312
You are quite a soldier.

881
02:00:39,313 --> 02:00:41,773
No, sir.

882
02:00:41,774 --> 02:00:43,942
I'm just a simple baker.

883
02:00:43,943 --> 02:00:47,237
You were a baker?

884
02:00:47,238 --> 02:00:49,322
Any family?

885
02:00:49,323 --> 02:00:51,241
A wife...

886
02:00:51,242 --> 02:00:56,242
and a baby girl born
last summer in Ohmiya.

887
02:00:59,291 --> 02:01:04,291
I haven't met her yet.

888
02:01:07,174 --> 02:01:11,136
It's strange.

889
02:01:11,137 --> 02:01:16,137
I promised myself to fight
until death for my family...

890
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:21,600
but the thought of my family
makes it difficult to keep that promise.

891
02:01:44,336 --> 02:01:49,336
A radio transmission from the homeland.

892
02:01:59,977 --> 02:02:01,603
<i>For General Kuribayashi.</i> ..

893
02:02:01,604 --> 02:02:06,149
<i>And his troops, who are fighting bravely
for our country...</i>

894
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:11,070
a <i>song will be sung by the children of
Nagano, which is Kuribayashi's hometown.</i>

895
02:02:11,071 --> 02:02:15,366
<i>On the waves of the Pacific</i>

896
02:02:15,367 --> 02:02:19,204
<i>down south from the Imperial City</i>

897
02:02:19,205 --> 02:02:24,205
<i>a small lonely island floats</i>

898
02:02:27,254 --> 02:02:31,049
<i>The fate of our Imperial country</i>

899
02:02:31,050 --> 02:02:36,050
<i>lies in the hands of this island</i>

900
02:02:38,557 --> 02:02:43,557
<i>lwo Jima</i>

901
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:48,691
<i>As long as we stand</i>

902
02:02:48,692 --> 02:02:52,946
<i>we shall feel safe, as the Imperial land</i>

903
02:02:52,947 --> 02:02:57,947
<i>shall forever be at peace</i>

904
02:03:00,913 --> 02:03:05,913
<i>We shall fight with pride
and honor at any price</i>

905
02:03:07,962 --> 02:03:12,131
<i>Our proud island</i>

906
02:03:12,132 --> 02:03:17,132
<i>lwo Jima</i>

907
02:03:37,116 --> 02:03:40,118
Do me a favor.

908
02:03:40,119 --> 02:03:45,081
Stay here and burn all these documents,
and my military chest.

909
02:03:45,082 --> 02:03:50,082
Everything happens in threes.

910
02:04:16,697 --> 02:04:19,824
We will make a general attack.

911
02:04:19,825 --> 02:04:22,869
Although Japan has lost...

912
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:25,622
one day...

913
02:04:25,623 --> 02:04:28,875
our people will praise your dedication.

914
02:04:28,876 --> 02:04:33,876
A day will come when they
will weep and pray for your souls.

915
02:04:35,633 --> 02:04:40,633
Be proud to die for your country.

916
02:04:45,059 --> 02:04:50,059
I will always be in front of you.

917
02:07:30,182 --> 02:07:33,643
No more.

918
02:07:33,644 --> 02:07:38,644
No more.

919
02:07:42,694 --> 02:07:47,694
Thank you, Fujita.

920
02:08:16,562 --> 02:08:21,562
This is an order.

921
02:09:26,173 --> 02:09:30,843
You again.

922
02:09:30,844 --> 02:09:35,844
I have one more favor to ask of you.

923
02:09:36,683 --> 02:09:39,018
Bury me...

924
02:09:39,019 --> 02:09:44,019
so that no one will find me.

925
02:09:55,619 --> 02:09:57,036
<i>Taro...</i>

926
02:09:57,037 --> 02:09:59,747
<i>I will be home soon.</i>

927
02:09:59,748 --> 02:10:02,708
<i>I'm glad to be going back to Japan...</i>

928
02:10:02,709 --> 02:10:07,709
<i>but I'm a bit sad
to leave my friends behind.</i>

929
02:10:09,591 --> 02:10:12,301
<i>I drove home...</i>

930
02:10:12,302 --> 02:10:13,719
but...

931
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:18,720
<i>it's lonely driving all by myself.</i>

932
02:10:28,777 --> 02:10:33,777
Is this still Japanese soil?

933
02:10:40,289 --> 02:10:45,289
This is still Japan.

934
02:14:02,949 --> 02:14:07,949
Be careful.

935
02:20:30,128 --> 02:20:35,128
