00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:55,042
"May 1943. Two years ago we said
farewell in Berlin."

3
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:59,283
"Two years and no end in sight.
At first it was just a new feeling."

4
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:03,524
<i>"But . The German Wehrmacht
isn't invincible."</i>

5
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:09,085
<i>"We took up position at Orel.
They say that there will be a last decisive battle."</i>

6
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:12,406
"The battle,
that will end war."

7
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:15,527
"I don't know if I can still fullfill
the expectations of my men:

8
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:19,048

9
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:58,658
Lets go.

10
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:20,383
Cover!

11
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:32,146
Get out!

12
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,836
Scared us quite much.

13
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:40,483
<i>Nurse, please help me!</i>

14
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:49,245
Nurse. A pressure bandage for the russian.

15
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:51,605
But we aren't allowed to...
Just do it.

16
00:03:57,047 --> 00:04:00,287
Head wound first.
What about the russian?

17
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:04,088
We don't even have enough morphium
for our own men.

18
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,929
Crank up the radio, Nurse Charlotte.
Nurse Hildegard, you assist.

19
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:22,172
(Vocals) "My tiny heart
craves after you."

20
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:29,814
"And the answer, when you ask me:
Yes, I belong to to you."

21
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:33,416
"Yes, I...

22
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:37,816
belong to you."

23
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:46,698
That was the famous singer
Greta DelTorres

24
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,660
with "My tiny heart".

25

27
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:03,983
<i>I thought the Obersturmbannführer
wanted to...</i>

28
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:09,664
I'm sorry, Miss Greta.

29
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:13,905
As far as I know he visits the opera with
his wife.

30
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:18,307
With his wife.

31
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:20,627
Get out! Faster! Go on, chop-chop!

32
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:29,069
Drive me home.

33
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:40,692
3 days until the battle of Kursk

"All will be gone."

35
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:50,274
"Two years in russia and not ponimaij."

36
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,795
<i>Get yourself some food.
- Jawohl.</i>

37
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:56,836
<i>Jawohl.
- Yes.</i>

38
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:59,477
Fresh out of basic.
Half children.

39
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,177
The older the war,
the younger the soldiers.

40
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,058
What about my holiday?

41
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,759
<i>The Oberleutnant said, that all holidays
are cancelled. We need every man to prepare
the offensive.</i>

42
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:19,641
Shit. My fiancee...
- You don't even have a fiancee, Bartel.

43
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:24,202
How should I get one without holiday?

44
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:30,024
Hello. If I'm allowed to introduce myself,
my name...

45
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:33,665
What was the name of the red head last week,
Schneider?

46
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:37,626
The one, whose head was blown off by a grenade.
- (stutters) Boom!

47
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:42,887
If you are still alive in four weeks you can
tell me your name.

48
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,068
And till then: One, Two.

49
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,790
Your brother will make men out of them.

50
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,751
Yeah, sure.

51
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,497
Nurse, what's your name?
Charlotte.

52
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:28,538
Do want to drink a bit with me?
I'm not drinking while on duty.

53
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:33,859
Then give me a kiss.
Today is my birthday, my 21st.

54
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:39,021
Happy Birthday then.

55
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:44,542
The shrapnels in my head are moving.
It's inoperable.

56
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:48,023
I must look like a ghost.
That's funny

57
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:51,224
<i>because we're from the 707th.
they call us the Gespensterlegion.</i>

58
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:57,585
<i>Gespensterlegion? Why is that?
Because we make the jews disappear.</i>

59
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,028
Even women?

60
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:34,074
What do you think, what happened to Lilija?

61
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:44,236
She was a good Nurse.
Listen, she was jewish.

62
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:47,637
And the jews want our demise, right?

63
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,920
Watch out that something like that
isn't overheard by the wrong people.

64
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:29,088
No knocking?

65
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,729
<i>Do you think that I'm one of your
BDM-Bunnies?</i>

66
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,529
I could have been naked.

67
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,410
There is nothing I don't know yet.

68
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:41,091
Tyke!

69
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,412
Does your wife have a migraine again?

70
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:50,533
Maybe we should meet each other
over a cup of coffee.

71
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:56,854
You should have called.
I didn't have time.

72
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:59,335
I need to learn the new songs.

73
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:02,376
You will need to learn a lot more of them.

74
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:05,257
What do you think about a tour?

75
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:09,218
A... tour?

76
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:11,898
Some dancers, a juggler.

77
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,619
And the main feature: Greta DelTorres.

78
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,660
I could ask Marika Rökk instead.

79
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:40,665
I could learn some french chansons.

80
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:43,706
<i>I always wanted to visit the Moulin Rouge.</i>

81
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:46,987
You will visit Paris afterwards.

82
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,188
Afterwards?

83
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:52,668
The tour goes east.

84
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,109
Ah.

85
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,110
Warsaw.

86
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,630
Uh well, I could also...
Russia.

87
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:05,651
What? You don't believe that...
You will sing in front of hundred of soldiers.

88
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:10,392
Dirty, smelly... officers,
that haven't seen women for a long time.

89
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,433
You will celebrate a triumph.

90
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,954
And after the victory: Paris.

91
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:18,875
Milan.
Rome.

92
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:21,155
Vienna.

93
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:22,956
Budapest.

94
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:28,477
All of Europe will stand open for you.
You should pack.

95
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:30,718
Tomorrow your plane will start.

96
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
What are our chances?

97
00:11:47,562 --> 00:11:50,322
<i>The german Afrikakorps has surrendered.</i>

98
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:53,803
It's only 300 kilometer from Tunis to Sicily.

99
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:57,444
And after that the allies will attack Italy.

100
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:00,205
We need to fend off the Russian.

101
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:04,846
<i>Excuse me, Herr Oberleutnant.
When are we finally going to fight?</i>

102
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:08,147
Will the Russians attack us?
- Of course we will attack first.

103
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,487
The german will allways attack first.

104
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:13,288
The Fuhrer says, that the war will
be decided till winter.

105
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,609
Did he mention the year as well?
- That's undermining of military morale.

106
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,770
Defeatism.
- Mhm.

107
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,410
Okay boys, it's late, Curfew.

108
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:29,692
<i>Good night, Herr Oberleutnant.
Good night, Herr Oberleutnant.</i>

109
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:40,915
<i>Go into the house kids, go!</i>

110
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,736
Get away from the well!

111
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:48,697
Schneider! Away from the well!

112
00:13:18,785 --> 00:13:20,785
Wait! Please stop!

113
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:26,626
Your flight will depart in 30 minutes.
I know.

114
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,830
Yes?

115
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:47,991
Excuse me, I might have...
Did ya wanna visit 'he jews?

116
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:51,792
Yes.
'hey 're gone.

117
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:54,633
Gone?

118
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:57,874
Berlin is free of jews now, remember?

119
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:03,314
'hey didn' even clean'd up the flat,
'hat dirdy plebs. You won' believ' it.

120
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:08,396
Shut it! Or 'he russian will come!

121
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:14,237
Ah, well. At least the furniture was
usable.

122
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,159
Say, do you 'ave somethin' to do with
'hose?

123
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:16,093
(Old man) What are you doing there?

124
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:23,054
Do you see that, she can't do that.
Stop it! They will shoot us all.

125
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:27,535
Stop the Train! Stop! Stop!

126
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:32,616
Hey! You dead. Maybe tomorrow or in a month
or in a year.

127
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:36,017
But scream again and you dead now.

128
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:39,378
That is apply to anyone.

129
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,739
Nobody need follow me, but nobody will stop me.

130
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:53,302
<i>I was in Sachsenhausen.</i>

131
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:57,702
<i>They said they need workers for a plant in Lublin.</i>

132
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,424
You are lucky.

133
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:03,064
Bon voyage then.

134
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:13,086
Is not strange that train depart always full

135
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:15,347
and return empty?

136
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:31,911
Come.

137
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:49,175
Gentlemen, now it's time. Our week-long
preparations will be finished soon.

138
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:54,676
Tomorrow our offensive will start with an
attack on the central russian front line,

139
00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:57,837
<i>that targets the front advance at Kursk.</i>

140
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:00,058
<i>The code name is: "Zitadelle".</i>

141
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:05,419
<i>The attack will be conducted starting from two
wedges starting at Orel und Bjelgorod.</i>

142
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,000
<i>East of Kursk we close the pincer
with Hoths 4th tank army.</i>

143
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:14,881
<i>This decisive battle will bring back the
initative to the german Wehrmacht.</i>

144
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:20,162
<i>Within six days Kursk must fall.
The Fuhrer expects every man to do his best.</i>

145
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:26,284
This evening a famous singer will appear
to raise the troops morale.

146
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:29,645
The men should relax
one last time before it starts.

147
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,206
Thanks.

148
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,687
<i>Oberleutnant Winter.</i>

149
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,091
I'm sorry to hear about the assault
on your troops.

150
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:55,251
The assassins will be executed
at this very day of course.

151
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,533
What's going on, Wilhelm?

152
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:06,454
We already had entered the outer
district of moscow.

153
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,335
And now it's more than 500 kilometer again.

154
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:15,256
I know, Stalingrad was a desaster.

155
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:18,537
But we still can win this war.

156
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:22,698
<i>We reclaimed Charkow and Bjelgorod.</i>

157
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:26,499
After we lost them.
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!

158
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,140
We need to win this battle.

159
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:35,341
That is the last chance to bleed out the Russians
before the Americans join in.

160
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:40,423
<i>And now leave.
Herr Hauptmann.</i>

161
00:18:57,507 --> 00:19:00,507
"How do you lead your men into a battle,

162
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:03,028
that most of them won't survive?"

163
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,749
"The real victors of this war are the flies."

164
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,430
"We feed them with our flesh."

165
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,111
Ten-hut!

166
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:17,212
Ready!

167
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,953
Fire!

168
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:33,355
You chickenshit missed on purpose!
- I...

169
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,357
You're such a stupid coward.

170
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:39,317
Friedhelm.

171
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,128
Come.

172
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,649
What do you see?
No train station. No city.

173
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,730
Wait.

174
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:39,331
Tanks. Train full of tanks.
Listen.

175
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,533
Military train have priority.

176
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:47,293
If we lucky, german planning something in
east and give us time.

177
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:51,894
We need to rest.
- Minutes. Then we continue work.

178
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:08,419
"My tiny heart

179
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,820
only beats for you."

180
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,540
"It knows the answer,
when you ask me then:"

181
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:20,402
"Yes, I belong to you."

182
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,222
"Yes, I...

183
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:27,663
belong to you."

184
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,348
Thanks.

185
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:57,191
Hello?

186
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:01,352
Listen boys, if you think that...
Friedhelm!

187
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:05,673
Hello.

188
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:12,554
What a surprise!
Nice to see you again.

189
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,795
Charly!

190
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:20,677
You were wonderful.

191
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:42,081
Who'd have guessed that.
We need to celebrate that.

192
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:50,004
Ah! Wait... I have it with me.

193
00:22:56,566 --> 00:22:58,566
We were so young.

194
00:22:59,807 --> 00:23:03,287
What happened to Viktor?
It was for is passport. He left.

195
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,808
He is well. I visited his parents.

196
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:12,129
Champain.

197
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,650
The Fuhrer says, that at the
end of the year Germany will have won the war.

198
00:23:19,171 --> 00:23:23,911
And then we four go to Milan and
Paris to my performances.

199
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,653
Here's to you, Greta.
Here's to you.

200
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,773
To us!

201
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,815
Knocking
Come in.

202
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:41,696
Ah, damn. The regiment commander
holds a private supper.

203
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:44,457
Coming!

204
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:47,858
Well then.
Take whatever you need.

205
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:53,379
And don't wait for me.
I believe it... will get late.

206
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,580
But I'm still here for a few days.

207
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:07,742
Well then, lets celebrate
Greta DelTorres in absense.

208
00:24:08,423 --> 00:24:10,223
Exactly. Yes.

209
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,625
I need to go too.

210
00:24:19,506 --> 00:24:21,746
<i>Hauptmann Feigl expects me.</i>

211
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:29,468
Yeah.

212
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,749
I need to go too, then.

213
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,950
Come on, what's that all about?
We party a little bit. Hm?

214
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:44,751
Wilhelm, what about you? We haven't seen
each other in ages. Here, a Bordeaux.

215
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:47,112
34. Charly.

216
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:51,833
Why can't we...
My patients are waiting!

217
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:10,318
You're an asshole, do you know that?

218
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:15,719
I don't want to get her hopes up.

219
00:25:29,323 --> 00:25:32,003
Your soldier with the head injury...
Yes?

220
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,804
Don't you feel well?

221
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:38,445
Here. What's with him?
He died.

222
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,690
Good.
Go!

223
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,733
Who is of brave come to us now.

224
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,857
I can't do that.

225
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:52,863
<i>Herr Leutnant.</i>

226
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:57,704
When we shot the peasants because of the well,

227
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:03,546
do you believe,
that all of them were partisans?

228
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:06,787
No.

229
00:27:12,748 --> 00:27:14,948
Did you kill a lot?

230
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:18,349
You kill them before they kill you.
Easy as that.

231
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:26,671
I wanted to sign up
for the winter semester in Freiburg.

232
00:27:26,832 --> 00:27:30,272
With Professor Heidegger.
Philosophy and history.

233
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,673
Do you believe... do you believe
that will work out?

234
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:40,114
Maybe you should go for
the summer semester instead.

235
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:45,115
Yeah, sure. My mother told...
- Shut up now.

236
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:48,197
Of course. Sorry.

237
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,484
One hour and 20 minutes.

238
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:22,525
What do you think?

239
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,767
It will be everyone's turn.

240
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,247
Schneider was killed behind the front line.

241
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:39,809
When he beat you up...

242
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,290
That was okay.

243
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:45,491
No, it wasn't.

244
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,532
I left you alone.

245
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,613
It is...

246
00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:00,694
It isn't always easy to know what
is right.

247
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:06,215
Father always expected from me that, I...

248
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:08,576
Shell impacts.

249
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:13,738
Attack!

250
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:17,738
(Soldier) To arms!
Move! Move! Move!

251
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:21,259
Faster!
Move! Move! Move!

252
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:26,781
Spread out!
Cover!

253
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:34,142
Fuck, they are firing too short!
- These are not ours you retard!

254
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:42,064
I can't take it any more...

255
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:11,632
Prepare everything.

256
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:24,475
Hey!

257
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:26,195
Wake up.

258
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:10,286
Miss Müller, we need to go.
Shortly.

259
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:13,007
The pilot needs to start now.

260
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:17,767
Do you think I'm going to leave all of that behind?
- If you think so, Miss Müller.

261
00:31:19,449 --> 00:31:23,169
Tell them they should wait.
I'm Greta DelTorres!

262
00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:36,852
<i>That are ours! Conk them, boys!
Eat Kruppstahl!</i>

263
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:46,215
It's alright.
That happens to most of us at the beginning.

264
00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:01,858
Let's get started.
Yes sir. Here we go! Stand up!

265
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:04,939
Here we go!
Come on, boys! Here we go!

266
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,140
Let's get startet!

267
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:11,341
The Russians know that we will
attack.

268
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:14,182
We won't surprise them.
I know.

269
00:32:53,152 --> 00:32:55,652
Press firmly. You'll make it.

270
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:58,712
I need an Infusion!
Greta?

271
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:04,274
Hang on. You'll make it.
These idiots departed without me.

272
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:06,515
What's your name?
Werner.

273
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:10,435
Look at me!
I tried to call the commander, but to no avail.

274
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:13,316
You will be operated.
I thought you could help me, maybe?

275
00:33:13,637 --> 00:33:16,237
What?

276
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:20,878
Nurse! Werner?

277
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,559
Werner.

278
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,480
I need a nurse!

279
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:34,361
Pick it up.
What?

280
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,702
Pick up!

281
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:40,763
Come on!

282
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:44,364
Count to three.

283
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:48,404
One, two, three.

284
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,350
The peasant calls something on polish.
Quick!

285
00:34:17,212 --> 00:34:19,452
Rifle shots
Faster!

286
00:34:40,818 --> 00:34:42,818
What are you planning to do?

287
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,299
No idea.

288
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,900
Going back to Germany. And you?

289
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,100
Warsaw.

290
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:01,903
Alina.

291
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:04,744
Viktor.

292
00:35:08,545 --> 00:35:13,505
I not thought I tell this to German:
Keep alive!

293
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:35,071
Stop! Stop!

294
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:38,032
Run!

295
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:41,712
Run!

296
00:36:00,277 --> 00:36:02,277
"July 7th, 1943."

297
00:36:02,798 --> 00:36:06,598
"For three days the greatest tank
battle in the war has raved,

298
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:09,159
the one, which shall bring the decision."

299
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,520
"Over 7000 tanks face each other."

300
00:36:14,081 --> 00:36:18,281
"Friedhelm was right.
The red army was prepared for our attack."

301
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:21,122
"The casualities were immense."

302
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:24,123
"We hope for reinforcements every day."

303
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:34,605
There is a telegraph station two kilometers
in this direction.

304
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:37,926
Your task is to claim and hold it,
together with the second platoon.

305
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:43,167
Will there be tank support?
- The resistance of the Russians is fierce.

306
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:46,048
We lost half of our tanks and forty percent
of the crews.

307
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,969
There is no support, since all reserves are
already engaged in combat.

308
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:51,569
You will capture and hold the station
under any circumstances.

309
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:13,895
No enemy movement.
We are here.

310
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:19,696
The telegraph station is located 300 meters
north east. This way.

311
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:24,577
The... the first-
The second squad takes the lead.

312
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:29,098
The first squad follows closely. Third squad stays
a bit behind to provide fire support.

313
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,699
<i>Understood?
Jawohl, Herr Oberleutnant.</i>

314
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,740
Lets go Ladies! March!
Lock and load.

315
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:40,561
Go, Go, Go, Go!
- (stutters) Come, you first.

316
00:37:57,786 --> 00:38:00,946
To the passage.
First squad leads. Go!

317
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,834
Hey!

318
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:34,515
Grenade!

319
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:02,962
Bartel, on my command!

320
00:39:06,163 --> 00:39:07,883
Covering Fire!

321
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,324
Go boy!

322
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:52,974
Advance!

323
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:12,899
Seibold, Winter, secure.

324
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:35,944
Move boy!

325
00:40:38,425 --> 00:40:40,625
Stand up... Ahh!

326
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,750
Tank!

327
00:41:04,992 --> 00:41:06,592
Get out!

328
00:41:25,757 --> 00:41:27,557
Retreat!

329
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:02,526
How do you bear that?

330
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:17,809
You have changed.

331
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,930
You're so...

332
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,892
I killed a women.

333
00:42:32,413 --> 00:42:34,653
Lilija. She was a jew.

334
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:40,174
She helped me,
and I betrayed her.

335
00:42:42,816 --> 00:42:45,796
Nothing is like we imagined, Greta.

336
00:42:52,658 --> 00:42:55,658
I hoped Viktor would write me.

337
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,700
I have no Idea how he is.

338
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:04,141
And where he is.

339
00:43:11,783 --> 00:43:15,263
This wound won't heal by itself.
That's dangerous.

340
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,344
It needs to be stiched.

341
00:43:21,825 --> 00:43:23,305
And?

342
00:43:24,306 --> 00:43:26,626
Why did you end up in the train?

343
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:34,188
After our capitulation

344
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,069
your men did caught me on street.

345
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,070
and send me to Germany for work.

346
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,110
A farm in Franconia.
What happended?

347
00:43:46,271 --> 00:43:49,751
<i>Didn't you like it there with some
Eisbein and Sauerkraut?</i>

348
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:52,472
And you? You're of Jew?

349
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,913
Maybe you undress in front of German.

350
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:05,396
Bite it.

351
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:31,962
<i>Where is Oberleutnant Winter?</i>

352
00:44:37,924 --> 00:44:41,164
Where is the goddamn backup?
- Where are they?

353
00:44:41,485 --> 00:44:43,485
They left us alone!

354
00:44:44,606 --> 00:44:46,766
<i>Herr Oberleutnant message from
Hauptmann Feigl.</i>

355
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:49,846
The Russians started
an attack at Orel.

356
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:52,747
And the allies landed on Sicily.

357
00:44:52,908 --> 00:44:54,928
There's your two front war.

358
00:44:55,248 --> 00:44:59,328
<i>They say, that the Fuhrer relocates
the II. SS-Panzerkorps to the west.</i>

359
00:44:59,669 --> 00:45:03,489
<i>And the Luftwaffe doesn't have
enough fuel for air support.</i>

360
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,930
We absolutely need backup here.

361
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:12,572
<i>I'm sorry.
We can't reach Kursk under this conditions.</i>

362
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:15,533
You should rest until tomorrow.

363
00:45:15,693 --> 00:45:19,893
But your Order is still to
capture and hold the telegraph station.

364
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:26,695
All of Sicily is abandoned

365
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:30,296
and my men are being sacrificed
for a piece of street!

366
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:09,906
You're relieved.

367
00:46:30,312 --> 00:46:35,052
You were right. It only brings out
the worst in all of us.

368
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:37,233
Yeah, I know.

369
00:46:37,553 --> 00:46:41,593
But this doesn't change anything.
We will fight again tomorrow.

370
00:46:42,975 --> 00:46:47,155
Until no one is left.
Exactly. Until no one is left.

371
00:46:47,976 --> 00:46:51,436
How many we knew
fell in the last two years?

372
00:46:51,577 --> 00:46:54,857
Schneider, Dogerlow,
Verbindsky, Bertok...

373
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:57,718
For no reason...
Stop it!

374
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:02,459
It will only stop when it has ended.
Don't you get it?!

375
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:07,599
We're just human cattle for the slaughterhouse!
Todays heros, tomorrows pigs.

376
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:11,081
But this doesn't make sense!
There is no sense!

377
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:13,802
God abandoned us!
There is only us!

378
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:17,582
No fucking general, no Fuhrer.
Just us, these men out there!

379
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:21,243
If we croak tomorrow then
so be it.

380
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,484
But you will lead us.
I expect this from you.

381
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:52,451
Two! Ammo!

382
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:26,579
<i>Herr Oberleutnant!</i>

383
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:49,305
Wilhelm!

384
00:48:49,746 --> 00:48:52,026
Wilhelm!

385
00:49:15,392 --> 00:49:16,872
Ah!

386
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,881
For that?

387
00:49:55,322 --> 00:49:56,882
For that.

388
00:49:57,642 --> 00:49:59,442
For that?

389
00:50:00,603 --> 00:50:02,563
God!

390
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:04,764
For that! Ah!

391
00:51:31,545 --> 00:51:33,865
We wait until it's get dark.

392
00:51:36,826 --> 00:51:40,466
If our men don't get here we'll go back.
Maybe we have a chance.

393
00:51:47,789 --> 00:51:49,789
How did you become like this?

394
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:55,770
You resist the temptation of being humane.

395
00:51:57,752 --> 00:52:00,352
Some go this way, some the other.

396
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,952
Nobody knows.

397
00:52:03,193 --> 00:52:05,793
But one thing is for sure:
nobody stays the way he was.

398
00:52:09,154 --> 00:52:11,394
How did you survive that long?

399
00:52:13,475 --> 00:52:16,275
You hope the one next to you is hit.

400
00:52:19,157 --> 00:52:23,117
A good soldier is a coward most of the time
and sometimes brave.

401
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:26,078
Then you aren't a good soldier.

402
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,320
Keep your head down, okay?

403
00:52:35,641 --> 00:52:39,921
The Russians have sibirian hunters, that
shoot a hole in a coin on 300 meters.

404
00:54:03,822 --> 00:54:07,022
The German came to me every night.

405
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:14,865
His women acted as nothing happened.

406
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:20,186
Than I realized, I...

407
00:54:21,627 --> 00:54:23,107
pregnant.

408
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:28,228
A girl.

409
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:32,429
They take away her.

410
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,870
Women of peasant aren't able to bear
children.

411
00:54:37,991 --> 00:54:40,591
But he also wanted boy.

412
00:54:41,632 --> 00:54:43,632
So he continued.

413
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:48,833
I hold knife at his throat and said:

414
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:52,273
"I don't bear German soldier."

415
00:54:52,434 --> 00:54:55,874
"And next time I cut off your little wiener."

416
00:54:58,316 --> 00:55:01,516
They fetch me and put me in waggon.

417
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:14,719
<i>Long way. But if we reach Lodz we have chance.</i>

418
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,000
Friends of mine living there.

419
00:55:32,244 --> 00:55:34,244
Where are the others?

420
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:36,845
Dead.

421
00:55:37,685 --> 00:55:39,165
All of them.

422
00:55:41,766 --> 00:55:46,486
Pack it up. The attack will be ceased.
We retreating.

423
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,516
<i>Water!</i>

424
00:57:05,707 --> 00:57:07,547
Your girlfriend?

425
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:10,188
My mother.

426
00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:19,789
I write her, that I won't study at Heidegger this summer.

427
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:29,912
I can't die.

428
00:57:30,153 --> 00:57:32,073
Good for you.

429
00:57:33,874 --> 00:57:35,794
No, I mean,

430
00:57:36,154 --> 00:57:37,634
my mother...

431
00:57:38,235 --> 00:57:40,835
beared me when she was 48.

432
00:57:41,396 --> 00:57:43,396
It's a wonder.

433
00:57:44,556 --> 00:57:47,116
She raised me all by herself.

434
00:57:47,717 --> 00:57:49,637
A simple women.

435
00:57:51,038 --> 00:57:53,798
<i>And the did go to the Wehrersatzkommando
and said,</i>

436
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:56,999
that I am her only son and that I must study

437
00:57:57,159 --> 00:57:59,479
and can't be conscripted.

438
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,640
Brave women.

439
00:58:05,522 --> 00:58:08,302
She was detained for a whole night.

440
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:11,202
For delinquency.

441
00:58:11,403 --> 00:58:13,723
A women, 68 years old.

442
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:16,884
Do you understand?

443
00:58:21,605 --> 00:58:24,245
Lets go. Lets get out of here.

444
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:42,570
I'm sorry Martin. But I can't take you with me.

445
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:13,912
I bet.
- No way!

446
01:00:14,073 --> 01:00:16,073
That was right in the heart.

447
01:00:22,755 --> 01:00:25,315
Ah shit. That's Friedhelm.

448
01:00:25,676 --> 01:00:28,556
Shit.
- I thought it was a Russian.

449
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:33,397
Why does he wear a...
- Just shut the fuck up!

450
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:13,607
Screams of agony

451
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:19,889
Do you hear me?

452
01:01:21,009 --> 01:01:22,809
This one can wait.

453
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:30,411
Hit right aside of the left heart chamber.
Great loss of blood.

454
01:01:30,572 --> 01:01:32,372
Not a chance.

455
01:01:35,013 --> 01:01:37,213
Friedhelm? Friedhelm.

456
01:01:40,294 --> 01:01:42,214
Friedhelm! Dr. Jahn!

457
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:45,735
What is with him?
Lost cause.

458
01:01:46,055 --> 01:01:48,735
Put this one in OR.
That can't be.

459
01:01:49,896 --> 01:01:51,816
I know him.

460
01:02:00,939 --> 01:02:02,419
Please.

461
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,180
Put this one on the surgery table.
But hurry.

462
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:13,081
No, you don't! You don't.
Nurse Hildegard.

463
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:18,663
Don't die on me.

464
01:03:44,164 --> 01:03:45,644
Friedhelm.

465
01:03:59,768 --> 01:04:03,048
Wilhelm...
I write Wilhelm that you're alive.

466
01:04:03,889 --> 01:04:05,369
No.

467
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:08,970
Wilhelm...

468
01:04:09,491 --> 01:04:11,291
is dead.

469
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:41,298
"September 1943."

470
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:45,539
"At the beginning of the war
you fight for your fatherland."

471
01:04:46,059 --> 01:04:48,619
"Later on, when you start having doubts,

472
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:53,140
you fight for your comrades,
that you don't want to forsake."

473
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:57,181
"But what happens if there isn't anyone left?"

474
01:04:57,822 --> 01:04:59,822
"When you're alone."

475
01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:04,103
"When you're the only one you can lie to is yourself."

476
01:05:06,344 --> 01:05:08,344
"What are you fighting for, then?"

477
01:05:18,387 --> 01:05:20,387
Take care of yourself.

478
01:05:52,236 --> 01:05:56,636
I wish you from all my heart, that you will
find your luck. Yes.

479
01:07:56,946 --> 01:07:58,426
Charlotte.

480
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,920
There you are.

481
01:09:02,522 --> 01:09:04,602
Does it hurt badly?
- It's okay.

482
01:09:04,763 --> 01:09:06,243
Oh God you're back.

483
01:09:07,924 --> 01:09:12,604
Do you see, I was right!
I prayed that he will bring him back.

484
01:09:13,925 --> 01:09:15,405
Yes.

485
01:09:17,046 --> 01:09:18,526
Him.

486
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:26,527
Wilhelm will be come back.
I know it. I know that he is alive.

487
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:31,928
I have some flour and two eggs.
I can bake some cake.

488
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,172
I'm so sorry that
it was a centimeter off.

489
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:57,855
"Then we will track back home."

490
01:09:58,016 --> 01:10:01,256
"Then we will be home again, home!"

491
01:10:01,817 --> 01:10:05,297
"Then we will track back home."

492
01:10:05,658 --> 01:10:08,378
"Then we will be back to home."

493
01:10:09,259 --> 01:10:13,739
"Our flag it waves..."
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

494
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:18,100
Please welcome the wonderful,
unique Greta DelTorres.

495
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:21,561
A toast on the beauty of our german
women! - Cheers!

496
01:10:21,862 --> 01:10:26,062
Well, already back? Well, I wasn't need
at the front anymore.

497
01:10:26,383 --> 01:10:29,543
You should have made a small visit there.

498
01:10:30,104 --> 01:10:32,944
Would you do us the honors and sing with us?

499
01:10:33,865 --> 01:10:36,585
(Men) Aw girl, come one.
- Come.

500
01:10:37,065 --> 01:10:40,625
Come here and sing with us.
Thanks, but I'm tired.

501
01:10:40,786 --> 01:10:42,906
Come, girl.
Don't touch me!

502
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:48,707
Seems like she expected something better, huh?
We're not good enough for her.

503
01:10:49,028 --> 01:10:52,108
Get a mouthful on the front fighters.

504
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:54,509
Only the mouth?

505
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:02,191
I have a surprise for you, gentlemen.

506
01:11:03,272 --> 01:11:05,672
Seems like the final victory will be canceled.

507
01:11:14,955 --> 01:11:16,955
Are you insane?

508
01:11:17,115 --> 01:11:20,235
If you still want to be heroes
you better hurry.

509
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:30,998
What is her name?

510
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:32,719
Greta.

511
01:11:33,959 --> 01:11:36,359
She tried to save me.

512
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,640
What she is do?

513
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:43,801
I would like to know that too.

514
01:11:45,642 --> 01:11:48,522
We couldn't even say goodbye to each other.

515
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:24,751
<i>Come out!</i>

516
01:12:26,992 --> 01:12:28,272
<i>Get out!</i>

517
01:12:28,633 --> 01:12:30,873
<i>We only stayed overnight.
We are already gone!</i>

518
01:12:31,873 --> 01:12:33,113
<i>Go in there, now!</i>

519
01:12:50,318 --> 01:12:52,038
<i>You can stay some days.</i>

520
01:12:52,918 --> 01:12:54,198
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

521
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:55,839
<i>Your friend doesn't speak a lot.</i>

522
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,520
<i>No.</i>

523
01:13:01,761 --> 01:13:03,001
<i>I go to the market.</i>

524
01:13:06,242 --> 01:13:08,082
<i>You two can help my son on the fields.</i>

525
01:13:09,922 --> 01:13:10,842
<i>Till then.</i>

526
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,045
<i>You must disappear.</i>

527
01:13:21,806 --> 01:13:23,506
<i>But... your father said...</i>

528
01:13:23,526 --> 01:13:26,366
<i>He goes into the town.
People who help the partisans will be shot!</i>

529
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:28,567
<i>My father will betray to to the German.</i>

530
01:13:29,227 --> 01:13:31,787
What did he say?
He gets your people.

531
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,168
<i>Follow me if you want to stay alive.</i>

532
01:13:36,789 --> 01:13:38,269
Come.

533
01:14:06,557 --> 01:14:11,637
Russia 41, or? Did you participate?
- Sure. The wound stripe.

534
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:14,878
<i>Infanterie-Sturmabzeichen.
The Mincemeat-Badge.</i>

535
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:18,439
<i>Nahkampfspange.
- Look, the Panzerkampfabzeichen.</i>

536
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,360
How many did you crack open?

537
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,640
According to the newsreel they're
throwing their last reserves against us.

538
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:30,322
That's enough boys.
Leave the man alone. Get out!

539
01:14:30,482 --> 01:14:34,042
Just because you are a hero
you won't to talk to us?

540
01:14:34,883 --> 01:14:38,963
In one year i will be seventeen and
I will get more than you got.

541
01:14:40,845 --> 01:14:43,005
This spoils us the war.

542
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:53,687
<i>I am aware that the Obersturmbannführer is busy.
You keep telling me that for over a mont...</i>

543
01:14:56,209 --> 01:14:58,249
Did you tell him my na...

544
01:15:15,813 --> 01:15:19,333
Rome is to close to the front line.
- But you promised!

545
01:15:19,654 --> 01:15:23,374
Let your father eat in peace.
- Then Florence. I...

546
01:15:31,577 --> 01:15:36,497
Please, dad! I want to see "The Birth of Venus" and
Michelangelo's "David".

547
01:15:36,819 --> 01:15:38,979
Please!
- We talk another time.

548
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,660
Who was it?

549
01:16:18,169 --> 01:16:19,609
<i>Good luck!</i>

550
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:24,850
<i>Who are you?</i>

551
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:27,210
<i>I am Alina Bigaj, this is Viktor.</i>

552
01:16:27,691 --> 01:16:29,491
<i>We are on the run from the Germans.</i>

553
01:16:45,035 --> 01:16:47,355
I don't understand.

554
01:16:51,637 --> 01:16:53,637
But you said...

555
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:56,277
No, don't. No, no. No!

556
01:16:56,438 --> 01:16:58,278
Mom... Mom, please.
- No!

557
01:16:58,839 --> 01:17:02,599
Nothing will happen to me. Listen!
Nothing will happen to me.

558
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,761
No! No!

559
01:17:31,967 --> 01:17:34,007
Hey, you over there! Come here.

560
01:17:35,168 --> 01:17:37,168
We got lost.

561
01:17:39,969 --> 01:17:41,889
Do you speak german?

562
01:17:49,651 --> 01:17:51,571
Hey look.

563
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:55,772
Somebody here thinks that war is over for him.

564
01:17:56,613 --> 01:17:58,093
Stand up.

565
01:18:00,254 --> 01:18:01,734
Stand up!

566
01:18:09,496 --> 01:18:13,696
<i>Oberleutnant Winter. 3rd company,
60th infantery regiment.</i>

567
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,420
Open up!

568
01:18:31,501 --> 01:18:33,501
Get dressed.

569
01:18:33,662 --> 01:18:35,782
What?
Now.

570
01:18:54,507 --> 01:18:57,067
Please sit down.
Do I finally get...

571
01:18:57,228 --> 01:18:58,708
Sit down!

572
01:19:04,629 --> 01:19:09,189
<i>I want an explanation...
This is a report of a Feldwebel which claims that
you expressed doubts on the final victory.</i>

573
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:11,431
Did you make these statements?

574
01:19:30,936 --> 01:19:32,616
<i>Are you polish?</i>

575
01:19:34,657 --> 01:19:35,657
<i>Yes.</i>

576
01:19:38,378 --> 01:19:39,818
<i>Where are you from?</i>

577
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:41,438
Warsaw.

578
01:19:42,439 --> 01:19:43,919
Warsaw.

579
01:19:59,343 --> 01:20:01,063
<i>I have a friend in Warsaw.</i>

580
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:06,023
<i>Junction Leszno / Ogrodowa. Franek Madajczyk.
Do you know him?</i>

581
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:08,245
Polish

582
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:14,626
<i>Everybody in Warsaw knows Franek Madajczyk!</i>

583
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:16,547
<i>That's maybe true.</i>

584
01:20:16,867 --> 01:20:19,587
<i>But there is no Franek Madajczyk at the
junction Leszno / Ogrodowa.</i>

585
01:20:20,428 --> 01:20:21,508
<i>Why not?</i>

586
01:20:22,027 --> 01:20:24,987
<i>Because the Leszno and the Ogrodowa
never cross.</i>

587
01:20:35,992 --> 01:20:36,992
<i>Is he german?</i>

588
01:20:39,593 --> 01:20:41,873
<i>Why you be with a German?</i>

589
01:20:42,433 --> 01:20:44,033
<i>Do you fuck him?</i>

590
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:56,616
Are you jewish?

591
01:20:56,937 --> 01:20:58,737
No.

592
01:21:00,358 --> 01:21:01,998
<i>Why are you so sure about that?</i>

593
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:04,598
<i>As you said: I fuck him.</i>

594
01:21:18,902 --> 01:21:21,062
He says something on polish.

595
01:21:24,344 --> 01:21:27,784
There are snitches.
The Germans pay a bounty on your head.

596
01:21:28,105 --> 01:21:30,385
Why should I keep you alive?

597
01:21:45,029 --> 01:21:49,229
What a bugger! Why didn't you respond to
my cal...

598
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:51,830
Sit down.
What's the big idea?

599
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,550
Sit down!

600
01:22:05,874 --> 01:22:08,394
Defeatism, demagoguery,

601
01:22:09,315 --> 01:22:11,395
vilification of the Fuhrer.

602
01:22:11,555 --> 01:22:16,435
You sent me there. Want me begone, away from Berlin,
away from you frigid wifey!

603
01:22:16,716 --> 01:22:18,636
Shut it!

604
01:22:20,677 --> 01:22:22,877
You can't arrest me.

605
01:22:24,518 --> 01:22:26,958
You would arrest you own child as well.

606
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,960
I'm pregnant.

607
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:13,170
Door is unlocked.

608
01:23:28,094 --> 01:23:32,294
I'm sorry. I tried my best in front
of the judge.

609
01:23:32,815 --> 01:23:36,735
Amnesia after a grenade impact.
That we both served since '40 in france...

610
01:23:37,056 --> 01:23:39,056
What's the verdict?

611
01:23:40,617 --> 01:23:43,897
Revokation of all german civil rights
and...

612
01:23:45,258 --> 01:23:48,378
death by firing squad,
execution tomorrow at six in the morning.

613
01:23:49,939 --> 01:23:51,419
I...

614
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:55,500
can try to get a clemency app...
The war is already lost.

615
01:23:56,301 --> 01:23:58,541
You just need to decide.

616
01:23:59,382 --> 01:24:00,862
Die

617
01:24:01,182 --> 01:24:02,982
or lie.

618
01:24:21,627 --> 01:24:23,827
Wilhelm, I am...
It's okay.

619
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,315
"Most people think,

620
01:24:56,836 --> 01:24:59,716
that war mainly consists of fighting."

621
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,597
"But that's not true."

622
01:25:05,238 --> 01:25:07,238
"It's waiting:"

623
01:25:08,838 --> 01:25:10,878
"for the next attack,

624
01:25:11,799 --> 01:25:13,719
the next meal,

625
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,920
the next morning."
