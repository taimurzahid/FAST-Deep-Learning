1
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:59,241
You showed us the path to glory...

2
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,441
with your holy words, 0 Prophet.

3
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:11,401
Allow me to acknowledge
my fellow brothers.

4
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:17,401
Essalam u aleyku m

5
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:30,281
- Es-selamu aleykilm.
- Aleykume selam.

6
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:37,361
What did our Prophet say, Eyyub?

7
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:42,321
Our Prophet said:

8
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:46,281
"Konstantiniyyah will
definitely be conquered one day."

9
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:50,481
The commander who conquers
it is a blessed commander.

10
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:55,401
"His soldiers are blessed soldiers."

11
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,441
In the year when Mehmet...

12
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:12,441
who would have the honor of becoming
that blessed commander when he was 12...

13
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,441
was born, many
miracles were witnessed.

14
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:19,441
Horses gave birth to
a lot of twin babies.

15
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:24,281
The land gave crops
four times in a year...

16
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:28,281
The branches of the trees bent down to
the ground because of the heavy fruits.

17
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:41,361
The comet observed over
Constantinople in the same year...

18
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,241
was considered as a sign that...

19
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:47,481
the unbreakable walls
of the city would fall.

20
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:04,801
EDIRNE
MARCH 29, 1432

21
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,721
SURA Of CONQUEST

22
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:53,361
Huma Hatun gave a
healthy boy, my Sultan.

23
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,361
Let him name Mehmet to show
our respects to our Prophet.

24
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:04,321
I gave him his name, may
Allah give him his fate.

25
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:11,281
SARUHAN POST

26
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:10,321
I told you...

27
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,241
I was going to defeat
you one day, Hasan.

28
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,361
And I told you that would be the
happiest day for me, my Sultan.

29
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:22,401
We have a letter from Halil
Pasha in Edirne, my Sultan.

30
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:55,441
Sultan Mehmet was only twelve
when he first took the throne.

31
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:58,321
Sultan Murat ll, who
had been tired of...

32
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,321
the inner conﬂicts between
his viziers and his warlords...

33
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:07,241
had decided to leave the
throne to his son, Mehmet...

34
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:11,401
after the unexpected death
of his favorite son, Aladdin.

35
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:17,361
But, Grand Vizier Halil Pasha made
Sultan Murat come back to his throne...

36
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:21,281
because of a possible
threat of another Crusader Army

37
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:26,281
And Mehmet was sent to Saruhan Post.

38
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:07,241
You had strong arms...

39
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:12,361
to conquer the cities
and bring the armies to heel.

40
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:17,401
They did not hold me not even for once.

41
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:25,441
You had sharp eyes seeing
the future of our governance.

42
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:31,441
They never...

43
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:35,441
looked at me tenderly.

44
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:41,401
They never saw how much I love you.

45
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:48,281
My heart was dying to kiss
the land you stepped on.

46
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:53,161
And now it is dying
to conquer the lands...

47
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:55,321
you will never be
able to step on, father.

48
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:59,281
To build a world-wide empire.

49
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:32,321
Why do my father's viziers stand aside?

50
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:37,401
Stand next to me
appropriate to your offices.

51
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:46,361
I returned to my birth-right
throne five years later.

52
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:50,241
What do you think about it, Halil Pasha?

53
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:53,481
You were...

54
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:56,361
too young at the time, my Sultan.

55
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:02,361
The Crusaders had passed the
Danube to expel us from Rumelia.

56
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:05,481
We asked...

57
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:09,281
your father to take back the throne.

58
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:13,361
It was all for the
sake of our government.

59
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,281
If you think...

60
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:20,321
this was a mischief...

61
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,401
then our lives are in your will.

62
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,281
I don't doubt that.

63
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:36,201
Therefore, for the sake
of our government...

64
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,481
I assign you the grand vizier.

65
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:47,441
Sahabettin, Zaganos and
Saruca will also be my viziers.

66
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:23,681
Murat Bey is dead, your majesty.

67
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:26,921
Sultan Mehmet took the
throne for the second time.

68
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:41,441
I see that you are as happy as I am...

69
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:44,321
for hearing the news.

70
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:46,441
Not me, your majesty.

71
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,161
It seems that...

72
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,401
Grand Duke Notaras fears that he will
besiege the city like his father did.

73
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,161
Just remember why Sultan Murat...

74
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,481
was forced to retreat from the siege.

75
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:03,241
It was enough for us to declare
Prince Mustafa as the sultan.

76
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,401
Even though...

77
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:09,281
the poor prince died
before he fulfilled his dreams.

78
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:12,401
Now we have even a
stronger sultan candidate.

79
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,401
Prince Orhan.

80
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:18,481
With all my respect...

81
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:22,241
this is delusional.

82
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:27,441
Sultan Mehmet's only desire
is to destroy our empire.

83
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:32,241
He studied sciences of
engineering to break our defences.

84
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:34,361
He studied our language to
understand our weaknesses.

85
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:37,481
And he studied our religion
to strangle our faith.

86
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,361
He might be too young right now.

87
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:41,441
But he is...

88
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:43,481
the anti-Christ.

89
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:47,441
Grand Duke Notaras, cease worrying.

90
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:52,241
Mehmet is an already overthrown Sultan.

91
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,441
He has no dignity in his own people.

92
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,441
We will show him our power...

93
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,241
before he will know it.

94
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,321
Send an envoy to Edirne.

95
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:06,441
Let Mehmet see our peaceful policies.

96
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,441
You are getting younger, old man.

97
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,161
And teaching the sultan to hold
a sword with his gentle hands...

98
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:26,241
did not lessen you, Hasan. Come here.

99
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:35,401
He learnt to use the sword from
you. But what about the reign?

100
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:39,281
Who will he learn to rule from?

101
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:44,361
You either have it or not.

102
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:49,241
Murat Bey was not like him.

103
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:53,281
We fought together with
him in Varna and Kosovo

104
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:58,201
I'm ready to scarify not one but
all my eyes for a sultan like that.

105
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,441
But Mehmet...
Be fair, master.

106
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:04,281
Our sultan was 12 years old back then.

107
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:07,241
Nobody cares about his age.

108
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,281
Was he on the throne? He was.

109
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:11,401
Was he overthrown? He was.

110
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:15,241
That's what people need to
know. They don't care the rest.

111
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:18,241
How would you like it, if
the infidels' dummy Orhan...

112
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:21,361
had taken the throne?

113
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,401
You don't know his virtues.

114
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:31,281
You will regret your words
when the day comes, master.

115
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:43,361
VATICAN

116
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,241
Sultan Mehmet...

117
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:52,481
will be determined about
what his father started.

118
00:13:57,361 --> 00:13:58,441
And don't doubt that...

119
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:02,321
his next destination will be Rome.

120
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:11,201
Emperor Constantine has to obey
the resolution taken in Florence...

121
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:14,361
about joining the churches.

122
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:17,321
We have to put pressure if necessary.

123
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,361
That's right. The biggest threat...

124
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:22,361
for that infidel Turk
is the Orthodox people...

125
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:25,201
praying for thr
Holy See and the Pope.

126
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:27,201
We should benefit from
his inexperience...

127
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:31,281
to get rid of the Ottomans for good.

128
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,321
Constantinople...

129
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:38,441
will either be a Moslem
capital or a Catholic capital.

130
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:45,361
I don't think Sultan Mehmet is
braver and smarter than his father.

131
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:49,361
But we have to consider
all the possibilities.

132
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:53,361
We can't leave Constantinople
to the infidels.

133
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:59,281
God is on our side.

134
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:08,241
KARAMANOGLU PRINCIPALITY KONYA

135
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,441
You are right, he assigned
Halil Pasha as his grand vizier.

136
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:15,321
He can't even get rid of someone
who took the throne away from him.

137
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:20,361
We should take advantage of this weakness.
Spread the word to other principalities.

138
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:23,281
It is the right time to
get rid of the Ottomans.

139
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:47,441
I am pleased...

140
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:53,281
with the beautiful words your
emperor had said about my late father.

141
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:56,321
And about Orhan...

142
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:09,441
Your emperor wants to
raise his subsidy...

143
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:12,481
to 300,000 coins.

144
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:18,401
It is important for our dynasty
that he lives a comfortable life

145
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:21,441
I will give my orders.

146
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:27,361
Tell your emperor that he will receive
the friendship he desires to build.

147
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,321
Do you believe Constantine's
sincerity, Mentor?

148
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:49,441
Neither his courage nor his strength
is enough for him to cross the line.

149
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,361
Contact...

150
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:58,401
with the Latin, Hungarian, Polish and
the Serbian king, and also with the Pope.

151
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:02,441
Tell them that we want to
live in peace with them.

152
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,241
Yes, my Sultan.

153
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:07,281
You can leave now.

154
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:12,241
Zaganos and Sabahttin Pashas, you stay.

155
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:20,201
I see that you are not
happy with my decisions.

156
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:24,281
It is not our place
to question the Sultan.

157
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:28,441
However, we might have
something to say...

158
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,441
if you discuss with us
before you give an order.

159
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,441
We don't have a more important duty...

160
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:38,281
other than conquering Konstantiniyyah
for the sake of our government.

161
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:41,441
We have to be patient until we
eliminate all the obstacles...

162
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:45,441
one by one and take over the city.

163
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:03,441
Mother. I really missed my father.

164
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:06,281
Not "father", but "my sultan."

165
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:08,201
So what will you call him?

166
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,281
My Sultan.

167
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:17,281
My Sultan...

168
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:20,321
I know there is a reason
for everything you do...

169
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,241
but...

170
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,361
giving Halil Pasha back his office...

171
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:27,001
and compromising with
Constantine caused disappointment

172
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:29,201
within your subjects.

173
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,281
It is considered as weakness.

174
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:37,361
I fear that if we cant win the trust...

175
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,241
of both our people and the army...

176
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,281
then we can have some
very serious problems.

177
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:43,481
Government...

178
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:48,241
is not a place of
displaying power, Zaganos.

179
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,241
It is a tool...

180
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:53,401
to protect their interest...

181
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:57,361
provide them wealth and
build a future for them.

182
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,441
Thats what makes a sultan powerful.

183
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:04,321
Dont worry.

184
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:09,241
When the time comes, my
army and my subjects...

185
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:12,441
will understand why
I made these decisions.

186
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:17,401
Check.

187
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:19,321
Welcome, Gulbahar Hatun.

188
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,321
It was a very long way, my Sultan.

189
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:26,241
But it is worth seeing you.

190
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,401
Yes, father!

191
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:31,401
My sultan.

192
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:35,441
Your son, Prince
Bayezid missed you a lot.

193
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,441
He called your name even
while he was sleeping.

194
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:43,481
Come on.

195
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:45,441
Go and have a rest.

196
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,161
Have you taken your luggage?

197
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:39,321
- Have a nice voyage.
- Era.

198
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:43,401
I caught you in the last minute.

199
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:46,361
I talked to the Duke one more last time.

200
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,401
But I couldn't convince him.

201
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:54,361
He is not interested in
your new crane designs.

202
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,321
I thought so.

203
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,281
But he said you can...

204
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,241
immediately build a cannon
foundry if your father accepts.

205
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,481
You know my father. He wont accept.

206
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:07,361
I know. And I told the Duke, too

207
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:12,281
Thank you for everything. I
appreciate what you have done for me.

208
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:13,481
Goodbye.

209
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:16,041
Era.

210
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:18,281
Dont go.

211
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:21,281
Marry me.

212
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:27,281
We shall bring your father here, too.
And I can convince the Duke in time.

213
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:31,481
Actually, I can even convince the Duke
to build a dockyard for your father.

214
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:33,441
I told you.

215
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:37,401
You will always be a very
valuable friend for me.

216
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,401
He just cant sleep, my lady.

217
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:29,321
Why didn't you go to sleep, my son?

218
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:34,241
Dont sultans love
their children, mother?

219
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:37,321
What are you talking about, Bayezid?

220
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:42,321
You will understand how much our
Sultan loves you as you grow up.

221
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,281
My son.

222
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:04,401
Mehmet.

223
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:09,321
I am your grandfather, Osman

224
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,321
I founded our principality.

225
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:15,321
My successors, your
forefathers, your father...

226
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:19,361
turned this principality
into a strong state.

227
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:25,281
And you will turn it
into a mighty empire.

228
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:34,481
You deserve this ring the most.

229
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:40,281
You are that righteous commander
who was acknowledged by...

230
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:41,441
our Prophet.

231
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:45,241
May Allah bless your campaign.

232
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:27,401
Your highness!

233
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:30,241
Are you alright?

234
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:35,281
Either I will conquer Konstantiniyyah...

235
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,361
or Konstantiniyyah will conquer me.

236
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:48,241
Isa Pasha.

237
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:49,681
Give my orders to the
dockyard in Gallipoli.

238
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:51,281
They should be able to
make 100 ships in a year.

239
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:52,441
Yes, my Sultan.

240
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:56,161
Sahabettin Pasha, I need the
foundry to make 3 huge crucibles.

241
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:57,201
Yes, my sultan.

242
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:59,481
Zaganos. Hasan? - He is already
in Konstantiniyyah, my Sultan.

243
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:02,201
Halil Pasha, and I want a full report...

244
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:04,361
about the gears and the
munitions of the janissaries.

245
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,321
Yes, my Sultan.

246
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,441
My Sultan, may I ask...

247
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:11,361
what all these preparations are for?

248
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:16,441
They are for joining our
state which is divided...

249
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:20,441
in Rumelia and Anatolia
together and make it a big empire.

250
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:24,241
I know what you mean, my Sultan.

251
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:25,481
But I am afraid...

252
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:30,241
there is a risk of shrinking and even
getting destroyed while trying to expand.

253
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:32,441
Making no progress already
means to die. Pasha.

254
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:36,241
We need to make bold decisions
for the future of our people.

255
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,401
Here is something very important
my ancestors taught me, Mentor:

256
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:41,361
Making history...

257
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:43,481
is no job for the cowards.

258
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:05,441
Leave it, you bastard.

259
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:09,241
Don't run. Come here. Catch him.

260
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,361
Come here.

261
00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:15,281
- Stop.
<i>-  I am very sorry.</i>

262
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,201
What have you done? Damn you.

263
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:19,481
- Stop. Dont hit me.
- Just watch where you are going.

264
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,321
- I tripped. What can I do about it?
<i>-  You made fall down.</i>

265
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,321
Where is the kid?

266
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:30,321
Where is that bastard?

267
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:33,441
Where did he hide? Anybody seen him?

268
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:37,361
Come on. Run.

269
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:11,321
So, how was the voyage?

270
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,361
It was no fun without you.

271
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:15,401
But not bad anyway.

272
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,441
- We had a storm for a while, actually.
<i>-  Really?</i>

273
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:20,441
By the way...

274
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:24,321
I got the book you asked me.

275
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:31,321
So tell me. What did the Duke say?

276
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:34,241
He is not interested
in our designs, father.

277
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,281
The fake noble.

278
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:40,241
He doesn't see the value
of the cranes I designed.

279
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:42,241
He has other things in his mind.

280
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:44,441
He wants you to make
cannons for his army.

281
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:46,441
They can go to hell.

282
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:49,441
Doesnt he know that I wont
make cannons for anyone anymore?

283
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:59,241
And what about Guistiniani?

284
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,321
The same.

285
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:04,241
He proposed me as always.

286
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:07,321
And you said no, as always.

287
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:29,441
Constantine invited
Orhan to dinner tonight.

288
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:32,241
Lets meet after the dinner.

289
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:42,481
To our Turkish friend.

290
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,441
To our Turkish friend.

291
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:55,361
We are informed that
Karamanoglu Ibrahim...

292
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:58,361
is making preparations for
a campaign against Sultan Mehmet.

293
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:00,481
Who do you think will win...

294
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:03,481
if he can find a strong support?

295
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:06,361
Karamanoglu, naturally.

296
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,321
Its not only us. Halil of
Candar thinks like that, too

297
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:16,321
Theres only one thing you should
do to take your righteous throne.

298
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,401
Help Karamanoglu Ibrahim Bey.

299
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:23,241
I am ready to do whatever it takes.

300
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:28,441
You can write a letter saying
that we all support Karamanoglu..

301
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:33,441
Including Halil Pasha, the
Latins, the Pope, and Hungarians.

302
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:38,281
You can even offer him some land.

303
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:41,321
If you do that, I will send
two different messengers...

304
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:45,361
from different routes to make
sure that it reaches Ibrahim Bey.

305
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:48,441
And we will watch whats coming next.

306
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:35,321
This is the letter Constantine
told Orhan to write...

307
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,481
and addressed to Karamanoglu Ibrahim.

308
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:40,281
Good job, Hasan.

309
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,441
The second courier group
must be about to arrive...

310
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:45,401
at Karamaoglus with a copy
of this letter, my Sultan.

311
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:14,361
Our plan works.

312
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:18,401
Karamanoglu started the campaign.

313
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:20,321
He fell into our trap.

314
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:23,321
He will be swept away if he
is defeated by Karamanoglu.

315
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,321
It doesn't matter even if he defeats.

316
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:28,441
His army will have heavy losses.

317
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:31,401
So he wont be able to mess
with us for a very long time.

318
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:37,361
Besides, we should double the
subsidy for Orhan to 600,000 coins.

319
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:41,401
Youll see, he will have to accept it.

320
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:46,401
And while my treasure raises,
whatever dignity he has left...

321
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:50,441
in the eyes of his
own people will diminish.

322
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:02,361
KARAMANOGLU PRINCIPALITY AKSEHIR 1451

323
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:05,281
I thought Halil of Candar
Pasha would support us.

324
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:07,241
Without Halil Pashas support...

325
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:11,361
he can't possibly gather such
a big army in such a short time.

326
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:15,321
The letter was nothing but
a big lie. We are fooled.

327
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:18,441
There is no way we can
have a victory if we fight.

328
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:23,241
Karamanoglu Ibrahim asks for peace. Lie!

329
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,481
He wants to provide us soldiers
and serve for our cause.

330
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,241
If we leave this pander alone now,

331
00:34:28,361 --> 00:34:30,121
he will uprise again in
the first opportunity.

332
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:31,361
This is not the way to govern.

333
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:36,401
Our army will have heavy
causalities if we fight.

334
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:40,321
I think it is better for us
to accept his offer, my Sultan.

335
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:41,441
This is crazy.

336
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:45,281
Your policies are nothing
but a bunch of coward actions.

337
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:47,201
I think my mentor is right.

338
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:50,321
He wont be able to dare
anything for a very long time.

339
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:55,361
He wont cause us any problems during
our campaign to Konstantiniyyah.

340
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,281
Go now.

341
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,401
Bring me that pander.

342
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:08,481
Bring him in.

343
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:29,241
Stand up.

344
00:35:32,441 --> 00:35:34,241
Dont forget...

345
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,321
you can battle with anyone...

346
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:39,441
but you make peace
only with honorable men.

347
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:44,401
I swear on my honor. No
more blood will be spilled...

348
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:47,201
as long as I live.

349
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:53,241
You will carry that honor of
yours until your last breath.

350
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,401
Or, your death shall come by my hand.

351
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,281
Who knows...

352
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:01,401
maybe this is your destiny.

353
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:24,481
- My Sultan?
- Read it.

354
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,441
Constantine...

355
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:41,321
wants to double the subsidy
we pay for Orhan, my Sultan.

356
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:49,241
There is no obstacle for doing this.

357
00:36:50,361 --> 00:36:52,481
Yet, this is neither the
right time nor the place.

358
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:02,441
He wants to take advantage
of us being in a campaign.

359
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:05,361
Out.

360
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:07,481
Mentor, you stay here.

361
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:15,281
I thought they didn't have any
other option but stay friendly?

362
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,401
I thought they didn't have neither
the courage nor the strength.

363
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:23,321
Is this your idea of friendship, mentor?

364
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,321
Is this your idea of friendship?

365
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:37,321
Come here.

366
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:42,321
I happened to capture...

367
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:45,441
this letter written
by Orhan to Ybrahim.

368
00:37:46,281 --> 00:37:47,361
Read it.

369
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,441
Here is what surprised me the most:

370
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:58,481
That serpent Orhan, says to
other serpent named Ybrahim

371
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:01,441
The Grand Vizier Halil
Pasha supports me.

372
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,321
But this should be secret for now.

373
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:14,281
Mighty Allah is my witness.

374
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:17,321
I have nothing to do with this letter.

375
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:20,321
I never left your father's path...

376
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:24,401
or your path in my entire life.

377
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:31,441
We will talk about this
when we go back to Edirne.

378
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:34,441
Now you can go.

379
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:40,361
Sultan Mehmet wanted to break Halil
Pasha's influence on the soldiers...

380
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:44,361
who was now in a very bad
position because of the letter.

381
00:38:45,321 --> 00:38:49,241
On the way back home, some
soldiers asked for guerdon...

382
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:53,441
even though they hadn't actually
fought. He used this opportunity.

383
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:58,241
With the pretext of deserted
soldiers he punished...

384
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:03,401
Janissary Master Kurtcu
Doban and his fellow janissaries.

385
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,441
Bu kendini bilmez Send these
blatant reptiles to exile.

386
00:39:08,401 --> 00:39:10,401
Yes, my Sultan.

387
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:16,481
Each of the blows these guys have
is actually addressed to me, Isa.

388
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:20,481
Karamanoblu, eh?

389
00:39:21,321 --> 00:39:22,281
Cowards.

390
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,361
They surrendered not
even drawing their swords.

391
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:30,361
Sultan Mehmet figured that our
friendship policy is a game.

392
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:35,281
He is not young and inept any more...

393
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:38,441
but a Sultan with his first victory.

394
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:42,481
You can be sure that
he wont send a dime...

395
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:46,281
of the 300,000 coin subsidy
he had agreed for Orhan.

396
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,321
Isnt it enough that you worried?

397
00:40:06,441 --> 00:40:09,281
How come such a letter can be written?

398
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:13,481
How dare he use my name in this letter?

399
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:17,401
Our Sultan knows that this is a trick.

400
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:21,361
Even if he doesn't, he cant
dare to do anything to you.

401
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:26,241
He doesn't want to cause
internal conﬂicts.

402
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:28,321
You re wrong, Emine.

403
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:32,441
He is taking control of
the government step by step.

404
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:36,281
Our Sultan wants you in
his presence, my Pasha.

405
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,441
Oh my... This late.

406
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,241
This...

407
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:44,281
means only one thing.

408
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:47,441
Go and bring my shroud.

409
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:51,321
(I witness there is no God but Allah)

410
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:57,281
(And I witness Mohammed is
his servant and his Prophet.)

411
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:13,401
Approach.

412
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:23,241
Give my mentor some water.

413
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,281
L...

414
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:36,281
never doubted your loyalty.

415
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:37,441
Otherwise...

416
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:39,441
you would have been beheaded already.

417
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:50,361
Acknowledge Constantine that we
wont be paying the subsidy any more.

418
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:53,321
Yes, my Sultan.

419
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:01,281
Come here.

420
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,481
What do you see?

421
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:14,321
I see the fort built my your heavenly
grandfather Sultan Bayezid, my Sultan.

422
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:20,361
What do you see, now?

423
00:42:21,361 --> 00:42:24,281
A new fort in Rumelia, my Sultan.

424
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:26,281
We will build...

425
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:29,281
a new fort right here
in Boéazkesen, mentor.

426
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,321
You will be in charge of
building these two bastions.

427
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:35,281
The moment we put the first stone...

428
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:38,281
Constantine, Pope and
the Latin governments...

429
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:42,361
will know what we are up to.

430
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:46,281
They will join forces and attack us.

431
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:49,441
Neither the Latins...

432
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:52,281
nor the Pope...

433
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:54,401
nor Constantine.

434
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,441
My only concern is my subjects...

435
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:04,321
who cant realize that its for their
interest to conquer Konstantiniyyah.

436
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:09,241
The blood will spill anyway.

437
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:11,321
The question is...

438
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:15,441
is it to become a
martyr or just to be wasted.

439
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:31,401
BODAZKESEN,
APRIL 1452

440
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:56,321
We will be able to control all
the ships coming from Black Sea.

441
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:04,361
Our Sultan.

442
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:11,401
Keep working.

443
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:20,241
He is building a fort
right in front of us.

444
00:44:20,361 --> 00:44:23,481
He will intercept the cargo
ships coming from the Black Sea.

445
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:26,201
He will make us starve.

446
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:28,281
He is preparing for a siege.

447
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:33,321
We should immediately
get ready for a war.

448
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:36,361
Send a word to Mora, my brothers.

449
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:39,281
Tell them to come here with their army.

450
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:43,241
Remind Guistiniani my offers.

451
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:47,361
Tell him that I will give him Limnos
Island if he commands my armies.

452
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:51,321
And this cannon founder...

453
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,161
- whats his name, Notaras?
- Urban, your majesty.

454
00:44:54,281 --> 00:44:57,441
Convince him to make stronger
cannons than we already have.

455
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:08,241
You were right.

456
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:13,281
Sultan Mehmet clearly revealed his
intention by starting to build that fort.

457
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:16,321
His holiness should take some action.

458
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:21,441
Mehmet will be discouraged if
we gather a strong Crusader army.

459
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:25,281
And Emperor Constantine...

460
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:28,241
will have no option
other than approving...

461
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:31,441
- ...the unification of churches.
- True. But...

462
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:37,441
Frenchmen and Englishmen are already
devastated because of their ongoing war.

463
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:41,321
And the German king is
struggling for his crown.

464
00:45:41,441 --> 00:45:46,321
And Mehmet is aware of all. He
must have considered all these.

465
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:51,321
Yet, Pope may perhaps convince
Venetians and Genoeses.

466
00:45:52,361 --> 00:45:55,441
We should send a messenger
to Constantine any way.

467
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:57,161
Youure right.

468
00:45:57,281 --> 00:45:59,321
He should know about our efforts.

469
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:03,441
We expect to finish the
fort in 11 months, my Sultan.

470
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,441
We have 5 months at most.

471
00:46:06,281 --> 00:46:08,241
We have to take control of the strait...

472
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:10,321
to intercept any aid
going to Konstantiniyyah...

473
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:13,321
before and during the siege.

474
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:16,481
We will all carry rocks if necessary.

475
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,441
My Sultan, Constantine asked help...

476
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:24,481
from Mora just like
you were expecting.

477
00:46:28,281 --> 00:46:29,481
I am sorry to see...

478
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:33,281
your unacceptable
attempts to cut off...

479
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:38,241
the route from my city to Black Sea.

480
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:41,361
Your intention is obvious.

481
00:46:42,401 --> 00:46:45,441
You think you can pass over my walls.

482
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,361
You will be disappointed...

483
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:52,361
just like your late father.

484
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:57,241
You stopped paying

485
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:00,241
the subsidy for Orhan...

486
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:03,321
because of a letter which
has nothing to do with us.

487
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:17,321
We didn't protest it for the
sake of peace between us.

488
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:20,281
But if...

489
00:47:21,281 --> 00:47:23,361
you don't stop building
the fort immediately...

490
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:26,281
I will send Orhan to Edirne...

491
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:29,401
and do all I can for him
to take over your throne.

492
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:33,241
And...

493
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:34,481
you must be in delusion...

494
00:47:35,281 --> 00:47:38,401
if you think that
Pope and the Latins...

495
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:41,281
will ignore your actions.

496
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:47,281
You will have to counter a Crusader
army of an unprecedented magnitude.

497
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:52,281
He says he will make Orhan the Sultan.

498
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:57,401
He should stop the plot he has
been keeping on for centuries.

499
00:47:58,441 --> 00:48:02,401
He must know best who my
people and my army support.

500
00:48:03,361 --> 00:48:05,401
And Pope gathering a Crusader army?

501
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:08,481
Be my guest.

502
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:12,281
We will defeat them
again just like we did...

503
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:14,361
in Varna and Kosovo.

504
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:16,441
I am...

505
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:19,441
not like my predecessors.

506
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:23,361
I am Sultan Mehmet Han.

507
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:27,401
If I want to make a fort in Rumelia
in my governance, then I do it

508
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:31,401
Everything in my land...

509
00:48:33,321 --> 00:48:35,441
is under my command.

510
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:24,321
Mehmet wont stop building the fort.

511
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,161
And he has started to gather
a big army in Anatolia.

512
00:50:27,281 --> 00:50:30,241
We started the production
as you ordered, your majesty.

513
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,281
We will burn him and his
army with our Greek fire.

514
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:37,281
And Pope says he is
determined to support us.

515
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:41,441
But as you know, with his condition
that our church abides him.

516
00:50:42,241 --> 00:50:45,361
Why don't we send Orhan to Edirne and
let him provoke people against Mehmet?

517
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:48,281
Thats impossible. His people
and his army supports him.

518
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:50,441
Then why do we still feed him?

519
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:54,321
Mehmet will not be able to pass
the walls. And this will be his end.

520
00:50:54,481 --> 00:50:59,321
What is more precious than having
someone on the throne loyal to us?

521
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:03,321
- Are the cannon foundries ready?
- Theyre renewed, your majesty.

522
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:05,281
I will talk to Urban, today.

523
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:08,481
- Here.
- Thank you.

524
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:18,481
- Father, we should also buy salt.
- Alright, my girl.

525
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:22,401
Engineer Urban. Grand
Duke Notaras wants you.

526
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:24,321
Father?

527
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:27,241
You go back home. Theres
nothing to worry about.

528
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:28,401
Lets go.

529
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:35,441
Welcome, Engineer Urban.

530
00:51:40,361 --> 00:51:44,321
As you know, our city is
fighting against the infidels.

531
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:47,321
This is not my fight, sir.

532
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:52,321
All Christians should fulfill
their duties. Including you.

533
00:51:52,441 --> 00:51:56,401
I have neither the desire nor the strength
to mold the cannons you want. Forgive me.

534
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,321
Think about your daughter, not yourself.

535
00:51:59,441 --> 00:52:03,361
We don't want that beautiful
girl get hurt, do we?

536
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,441
You have time till morning
to change your mind.

537
00:52:07,321 --> 00:52:08,441
You can go now.

538
00:52:12,361 --> 00:52:14,281
Come on, hurry up.

539
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:18,441
We have to go before Notaras dogs come.

540
00:52:26,441 --> 00:52:28,401
You are arrested by the
order of Grand Duke Notaras.

541
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:31,721
Seize them.

542
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,441
Leave my daughter alone.

543
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,281
Don't touch me, you jerk.

544
00:53:25,281 --> 00:53:28,481
Sultan Mehmet wishes
to see you in his court.

545
00:53:37,401 --> 00:53:38,441
We are informed that...

546
00:53:39,281 --> 00:53:41,321
those were Turks who kidnapped Urban.
Rascal.

547
00:53:41,441 --> 00:53:44,361
He will attack my walls
with the cannons Urban makes.

548
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:46,441
Find away to kill Urban.

549
00:53:48,321 --> 00:53:51,481
We have news from Mora,
your brothers, your majesty.

550
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:56,441
Mehmets soldiers have burnt down Mora.

551
00:53:58,281 --> 00:54:00,321
They killed all the troops...

552
00:54:02,241 --> 00:54:03,401
of your brothers.

553
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:10,361
God damn Turk.

554
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,401
He is always one step ahead. Always.

555
00:54:16,481 --> 00:54:20,361
We are sorry to take
you to Edirne by force.

556
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:24,361
Actually you made a big favor to us.

557
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:30,281
Helping your sultans cause...

558
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:33,241
may help me conclude
a personal matter.

559
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:34,441
What is it?

560
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:39,361
Years ago, the Crusader army
also supported by Constantine...

561
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:42,401
to wipe you out from the Balkans...

562
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:45,481
burnt down all the
Moslem villages on their way.

563
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:51,281
Including our village, too.

564
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:42,401
They slaughtered my family.

565
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:50,281
I found myself in the slave
market in Constantinople.

566
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:06,281
If it wasnt Urban who
pitied and bought me...

567
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,481
So, Urban is not your father.

568
00:56:09,281 --> 00:56:10,361
He is like a father to me.

569
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:14,321
Engineer Urban has been
my father since then.

570
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:21,321
Come on, we should start
as soon as possible.

571
00:56:24,321 --> 00:56:26,441
I am master at moulding
cannons as much as my father.

572
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:29,321
But we cant have a girl in the foundry.

573
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:32,481
Dont worry. They wont see a girl.

574
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:37,361
Let's go.

575
00:56:38,241 --> 00:56:39,281
Come on, Father.

576
00:56:48,481 --> 00:56:51,281
We don't have any other option.

577
00:56:55,401 --> 00:56:57,321
Write a letter to Pope.

578
00:56:57,441 --> 00:57:00,281
Tell him that I am ready to host...

579
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:02,481
a united ceremony with Catholic
and Orthodox people within my lands.

580
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:06,441
It is time to become united...

581
00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:09,281
against the anti-Christ.

582
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:15,241
If we call the Latins, they
will never leave our city.

583
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:19,281
Did you forget what they had done to us?

584
00:57:19,401 --> 00:57:22,441
They harmed our faith and our
city more than anybody else.

585
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:28,201
Mehmet will take action as soon as
he can. We don't have time to lose.

586
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:30,241
I implore you, your highness.

587
00:57:30,361 --> 00:57:33,361
This decision will take our
religion under Pope's command.

588
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:36,241
This means the end of our faith.

589
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:39,441
I prefer seeing Turkish
turban in the city...

590
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:43,321
rather than the Latin cone.

591
00:57:47,401 --> 00:57:50,361
We don't want the faithless
Catholics in Hagia Sophia.

592
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:53,321
We won't give away our religion to Pope.

593
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:55,481
We won't pray in the same
church with the Latins.

594
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:58,241
We don't want their prayers.

595
00:57:58,361 --> 00:58:00,481
They're trying to take over our faith.

596
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:04,321
It is time to say no to
these lousy Catholics...

597
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:07,321
who feed on the blood of
real Christians like ourselves...

598
00:58:07,441 --> 00:58:09,241
who follow jesus.

599
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:57,321
Engineer Urban...

600
00:58:58,321 --> 00:59:00,441
I am pleased to see you
and your assistant with us.

601
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:02,281
Thank you, your highness.

602
00:59:02,401 --> 00:59:04,441
I want you to make a cannon big enough
to break the walls of Konstantiniyyah.

603
00:59:05,361 --> 00:59:09,281
Something never will be
seen in history again.

604
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:12,321
We can cast the cannon
as big as you want.

605
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:16,401
Hasan will be here all the time
to provide your safety and needs.

606
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:20,241
- May your job be easy.
- Thank you, your highness.

607
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:27,241
May Allah...

608
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,361
make our efforts free from troubles

609
00:59:30,241 --> 00:59:31,361
Don't let us fail.

610
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:36,321
- Let our soldiers be victorious.
- Amen.

611
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:53,361
(Power and strength
only come from Allah)

612
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:56,441
- Allah is great.
<i>-  Allah is great.</i>

613
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:16,281
- Do you need help, engineer Elias?
- What?

614
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,401
We can't call you Era in public, can we?

615
01:00:21,241 --> 01:00:23,401
Shut up. I look like a boy.

616
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,401
I think you are as beautiful
as you were in the market.

617
01:00:33,481 --> 01:00:36,361
BOGAZKESEN SEPTEMBER 1452

618
01:00:38,321 --> 01:00:40,401
Oh my. The rumors are true.

619
01:00:41,281 --> 01:00:43,281
Turks have accomplished a miracle.

620
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:46,401
They signal us to stop.

621
01:00:49,321 --> 01:00:51,361
We are not going to stop
just because they want so.

622
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,241
Sink it down.

623
01:01:04,241 --> 01:01:06,321
How can he dare to sink my ship?

624
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:09,241
He is preparing to siege
Constantinople, your Grace.

625
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:13,401
Blocking our trade means
a war against us, too.

626
01:01:17,281 --> 01:01:19,361
But we can't fight him directly.

627
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:23,241
We should better supply
support for Constantine.

628
01:01:24,241 --> 01:01:28,281
I can go there with our ships and
command Constantine's army, your Grace.

629
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:31,241
Make your preparations right away.

630
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,241
Yes, your Grace.

631
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,281
Genoeses needed their trade route...

632
01:01:42,401 --> 01:01:46,321
to be blocked to
come to their senses.

633
01:01:48,281 --> 01:01:49,481
They will bring reinforcement, too.

634
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:53,241
And you, my dear lsidor.

635
01:01:54,361 --> 01:01:58,441
I am sure you can arrange
Catholics and Orthodoxies...

636
01:01:59,361 --> 01:02:02,441
pray together in church.

637
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:05,241
If you can achieve it...

638
01:02:05,401 --> 01:02:09,281
I can provide more
reinforcements to save the city.

639
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:14,481
I will send a huge army of
archers with you to Constantinople.

640
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:18,161
The city has to trust you...

641
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:22,321
for us to succeed.

642
01:02:26,361 --> 01:02:28,441
May God bless you.

643
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:51,361
I was worried that I wouldn't be
able to build what I designed...

644
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:54,441
when I decided not
to cast cannons any more.

645
01:02:55,241 --> 01:02:56,321
But now...

646
01:02:57,361 --> 01:02:59,281
I am glad you convinced me.

647
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,401
I know you did it for me, father.

648
01:03:03,441 --> 01:03:05,201
Let me check the designs one more time.

649
01:03:05,321 --> 01:03:06,361
Alright, father.

650
01:03:21,401 --> 01:03:23,321
I am so grateful to the Pope.

651
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:28,361
Your existence brings high spirits
to my people and power to my army.

652
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:33,241
It is obvious that you
need more, your majesty.

653
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:38,441
If you want the support of Latin
governments against the infidel Turks...

654
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:41,321
you know what you have to do.

655
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:46,361
As Pope himself insists...

656
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:50,401
Orthodox people should
accept Vatican's authority.

657
01:03:55,441 --> 01:04:00,481
It shouldn't be hard for a mighty
emperor like yourself to silence Gennadius

658
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:04,361
We will do what needs to be done.

659
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:07,441
My dear people.

660
01:04:08,241 --> 01:04:12,401
How can a emperor who seeks salvation
from the Pope defend our faith?

661
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:16,321
And what is our patriarch doing?

662
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:18,481
He is selling our
religion in Hagia Sophia...

663
01:04:19,281 --> 01:04:22,281
instead of giving us strength.

664
01:04:23,281 --> 01:04:25,201
He accepts to pray...

665
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:28,401
in Catholics' way.
Instead of our own.

666
01:04:29,441 --> 01:04:32,161
They want to make Orthodox people...

667
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:35,281
the slaves of the Catholic church.

668
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:37,321
Will you allow that?

669
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:38,441
Damn with the Patriarch.

670
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:42,361
There he is!

671
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:52,321
Get out of my way.

672
01:04:55,281 --> 01:04:56,361
Please consider...

673
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:59,241
your decision one
more time, my Sultan.

674
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:03,401
We know that the Pope
has sent an archer legion.

675
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,281
And we are informed that...

676
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:10,321
Venetians and Genoeses will
provide troops and galleys.

677
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,281
It is obvious that Germans...

678
01:05:13,401 --> 01:05:16,361
Englishmen and Frenchmen are
going to send huge reinforcements.

679
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:18,481
English and French armies...

680
01:05:19,321 --> 01:05:21,481
destroyed each other.

681
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:23,441
The German King...

682
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:26,321
is busy with his own inner conﬂicts

683
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:30,281
Aren't you supposed
to know what is going

684
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:33,681
on in Europe better
than all of us, Mentor?

685
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:36,481
I heard enough of your
opposition in this matter.

686
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:38,441
My decision is final.

687
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:40,401
You should...

688
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:44,321
better realize that the siege is
better for your own interests, too.

689
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,481
Otherwise...

690
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:50,281
Zaganos.

691
01:05:50,401 --> 01:05:52,441
Tell our spies to contact Gennadius.

692
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:56,241
Let them know that we guarantee...

693
01:05:56,361 --> 01:06:00,361
their freedom of prayers
without any Catholic pressure.

694
01:06:00,481 --> 01:06:02,361
And talk to Urban.

695
01:06:02,481 --> 01:06:05,081
That cannon must be
finished as soon as possible.

696
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:07,361
We will start the
campaign in two months.

697
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:09,321
Yes, my Sultan.

698
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:22,241
After all that dust and mud,
this place is great for a change.

699
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:25,161
Thank you, Hasan.

700
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,401
I bet you have never eaten
such a delicious fish.

701
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:31,081
It smells great.

702
01:06:31,201 --> 01:06:32,481
I added some ginger and laurel leaves.

703
01:06:33,441 --> 01:06:35,321
I learnt it from my father.

704
01:06:36,281 --> 01:06:39,001
You have never talked about your family.

705
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:42,441
My mother died when I was very young.

706
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:46,361
My father was a great warrior.

707
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:48,401
We went to Battle of Kosovo together.

708
01:06:49,321 --> 01:06:50,481
He became martyr there.

709
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:56,361
Wanna taste it?

710
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:03,241
It is delicious.

711
01:07:03,361 --> 01:07:05,201
It's a good thing that
I learnt the secret.

712
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,441
So you teach me to make
cannons and we get even.

713
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:09,441
You can't learn it right away.

714
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:11,321
It is an art.

715
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:13,281
This is the fourth time.

716
01:08:13,401 --> 01:08:16,361
The metal is not pure
enough. It has veins.

717
01:08:17,401 --> 01:08:19,441
I don't know why you object it?

718
01:08:20,281 --> 01:08:21,441
We should include more tin.

719
01:08:22,241 --> 01:08:25,481
That makes the solution denser. It will
congeal before it reaches the mould.

720
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:29,321
We can empower the fire.

721
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:33,281
It is powerful enough.
The next step is hell fire.

722
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:36,481
Why don't we give it a try? The
crucibles can endure more heat.

723
01:08:38,321 --> 01:08:40,321
No. It is too risky.

724
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:42,361
You say no to everything.

725
01:08:55,401 --> 01:08:58,321
Dear Giovanni Longo Di Giustiniani.

726
01:08:58,441 --> 01:09:00,201
Your majesty.

727
01:09:00,321 --> 01:09:03,401
You came here to help us against
the unbelievable of fences...

728
01:09:04,321 --> 01:09:06,401
of the infidel army.

729
01:09:07,321 --> 01:09:09,281
You and your heroic soldiers...

730
01:09:09,401 --> 01:09:12,241
are worth more than anything for us.

731
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:17,361
Of course, we are
grateful for their support.

732
01:09:17,481 --> 01:09:20,241
But there are also a
considerable number of people...

733
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:23,361
who haven't forgotten
the pain caused by...

734
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:26,361
the Latin armies, as well
as who greet them exuberantly.

735
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:30,241
Don't you think you are
unfair to soldiers...

736
01:09:30,361 --> 01:09:33,361
who came to die for your
city, Grand Duke Notaras?

737
01:09:36,361 --> 01:09:37,321
Our people...

738
01:09:37,441 --> 01:09:40,481
will embrace these heroic soldiers...

739
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:43,401
who came to die for them, Notaras.

740
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:46,401
Never doubt that.

741
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:50,441
Maybe you are right.

742
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,201
We are almost out of copper, father.

743
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:55,481
I know. They will deliver it tomorrow.

744
01:09:56,281 --> 01:09:58,281
Night shift is about to arrive, master.

745
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:00,321
You go and have a rest, Foreman
Mahmut. We will be staying.

746
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:01,441
Alright, master.

747
01:10:03,401 --> 01:10:06,201
Why don't we leave
early today for a change?

748
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:08,281
I will make a delicious supper for you.

749
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:11,361
And I was wondering when you
were going to suggest this.

750
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:13,201
Please, father.

751
01:10:13,321 --> 01:10:14,441
I know. Just help me take...

752
01:10:22,441 --> 01:10:24,321
This is Notoras' business.

753
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:26,441
Thank you Hasan.

754
01:10:28,281 --> 01:10:29,241
Seems like...

755
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:32,481
we won't rest until the walls fall.

756
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:37,041
Hasan.

757
01:11:51,401 --> 01:11:52,441
What do you think, father?

758
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:55,241
I think we did it this time.

759
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:56,401
Thanks to you.

760
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,601
It's a good thing we signed a pact with

761
01:12:09,721 --> 01:12:11,441
Hungarian, Serbian,
Polish and Georgian kings.

762
01:12:12,281 --> 01:12:15,401
So we won't have any
problems during the siege.

763
01:12:16,321 --> 01:12:20,281
They also thanked for the
beautiful presents you sent.

764
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:21,361
Good.

765
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:25,241
Halil Pasha saw that
he worried for nothing.

766
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:27,241
Are my warlords coming?

767
01:12:27,361 --> 01:12:31,401
The cavalrymen of Karesi, Hamit and Mente?
Warlords will be in Edirne very soon.

768
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:33,361
What about the ships?

769
01:12:34,241 --> 01:12:36,321
- They will be ready in time, my Sultan.
- Good.

770
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:45,361
(As I yearn to unite with my love)

771
01:12:47,241 --> 01:12:51,281
(What is so natural than
my tears becoming a sea)

772
01:13:03,321 --> 01:13:06,361
(You can't bring the beloved
to the house of sorrow, O Avni)

773
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:10,361
(No matter how strong your authority is)

774
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:19,441
Which perfume would you perefer to wear?

775
01:13:23,361 --> 01:13:24,401
Jasmina.

776
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:31,441
He loves this the most.

777
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:12,321
I took...

778
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:17,321
this amulet from my
father when they killed him.

779
01:14:18,401 --> 01:14:21,361
To give to my man if
I have one, one day.

780
01:14:28,441 --> 01:14:30,401
I will never take it off.

781
01:14:34,321 --> 01:14:36,441
Today is the big day.
I am very excited. You?

782
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:38,521
Me, too.

783
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:44,361
I don't want you to
be in the siege, Era.

784
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:48,361
You know I will. We talked about it.

785
01:14:52,441 --> 01:14:54,401
I don't want you to get hurt.

786
01:14:56,281 --> 01:14:57,441
I don't want you to get hurt, either.

787
01:14:58,361 --> 01:15:00,281
So don't go to war, too.

788
01:15:04,321 --> 01:15:06,281
War is not for women, Era.

789
01:15:09,481 --> 01:15:11,281
Not for women, did you say?

790
01:15:11,401 --> 01:15:13,241
You seem to forget what I went through.

791
01:15:13,361 --> 01:15:15,441
They killed my mother
and sisters in the war.

792
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:17,441
None of them was a soldier.

793
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,401
They were slaughtered not in
the front line but at home.

794
01:15:21,361 --> 01:15:23,281
Men die with honor in a war.

795
01:15:23,401 --> 01:15:26,281
But women lose their
fathers, children...

796
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:28,321
husbands, honor, everything.

797
01:15:30,321 --> 01:15:31,441
I will go to this war.

798
01:15:32,481 --> 01:15:34,361
Nobody can stop me.

799
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,441
Kudos to all of you, Engineer Urban.

800
01:17:02,321 --> 01:17:04,281
Thank you, my Sultan.

801
01:17:07,441 --> 01:17:09,281
Have a safe trip.

802
01:18:20,481 --> 01:18:23,281
I think you are right.

803
01:18:23,441 --> 01:18:25,401
I was selfish. I am sorry.

804
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:38,481
We are going back.

805
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:44,881
CALLIPOLI

806
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:54,281
Allah is great!

807
01:18:55,241 --> 01:18:57,401
Allah is great!

808
01:20:14,361 --> 01:20:17,241
You win. Well done, Mehmet.

809
01:20:17,361 --> 01:20:18,361
Our Sultan!

810
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,441
Father.

811
01:20:38,321 --> 01:20:39,921
Bayezid.

812
01:20:43,401 --> 01:20:44,441
Come here.

813
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:49,281
Come here, son.

814
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:03,361
Father.

815
01:21:37,241 --> 01:21:38,361
I wrote this for you.

816
01:22:25,241 --> 01:22:26,361
My noble commanders...

817
01:22:27,241 --> 01:22:28,361
brave soldiers...

818
01:22:28,481 --> 01:22:31,321
and faithful people.

819
01:22:32,321 --> 01:22:34,281
They dare to threaten...

820
01:22:34,401 --> 01:22:39,241
our walls protected by our
guardian angel Mother Mary..

821
01:22:39,481 --> 01:22:43,281
Who is not overwhelmed by anything.

822
01:22:43,441 --> 01:22:48,801
Damn the Turks.

823
01:22:49,441 --> 01:22:53,441
The infidel Turks are on their way...

824
01:22:54,321 --> 01:22:58,401
to bite with their
poisonous fang of a snake.

825
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:05,201
They think they can
pass the most glorious...

826
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:07,401
and the strongest walls in history.

827
01:23:09,441 --> 01:23:13,321
But we will drown them
in their own blood.

828
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:16,241
Death for the Turks.
Death for the Turks.

829
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:17,281
You...

830
01:23:17,401 --> 01:23:20,441
the children of Constantinople...

831
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:23,281
the queen city of the world...

832
01:23:23,401 --> 01:23:26,441
I know that when the day comes...

833
01:23:27,321 --> 01:23:30,281
you will all become fighters
worthy of St. Theodora...

834
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:34,241
and make another saga.

835
01:23:34,441 --> 01:23:36,401
God is with us.

836
01:23:37,241 --> 01:23:40,361
God is with us.

837
01:23:41,361 --> 01:23:44,481
Damn the Turks!

838
01:24:10,241 --> 01:24:11,481
You take the Pigi Gate, Nikola Mozenigo.

839
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:14,481
Cresca Gate. Commander Contarini,
deploy your troops there

840
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:16,241
Yes, your majesty.

841
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:17,481
Kaligaria Gate, John of Germania.

842
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:19,201
Yes, your majesty.

843
01:24:19,321 --> 01:24:21,321
- Knight Guistiniani.
<i>-  Yes, your majesty?</i>

844
01:24:21,441 --> 01:24:24,441
You will guard Romanos Gate
both with your own troops...

845
01:24:25,281 --> 01:24:26,481
and the archers
Pope has sent with you.

846
01:24:27,281 --> 01:24:28,321
This is our weakest point.

847
01:24:28,441 --> 01:24:31,241
May God forbid, if Turks
happen to enter the city...

848
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:34,281
- ...you will be first to encounter them.
- Don't worry.

849
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:37,361
I will not allow even one
Turk to pass through that gate.

850
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:41,441
And our Turkish friend Orhan
will guard the Langa Port

851
01:24:42,281 --> 01:24:43,401
Yes, your majesty.

852
01:24:44,401 --> 01:24:46,441
May God protect our city.

853
01:24:55,241 --> 01:25:00,001
EASTER APRIL 1, 1453

854
01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:32,441
And you, Karaca Pasha.

855
01:25:34,361 --> 01:25:36,441
This line from Gate of
Charisius to Ayvansaray is yours.

856
01:25:37,241 --> 01:25:38,241
Yes, my Sultan

857
01:25:38,361 --> 01:25:39,281
Sahabettin Pasha.

858
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:42,321
You take position from
Tekfur Palace to Egrikapi.

859
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:44,201
Yes, my Sultan.

860
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:45,321
Suleyman Pasha...

861
01:25:45,441 --> 01:25:47,401
our navy must enter the Golden Horn.

862
01:25:48,241 --> 01:25:49,361
It is the weakest point of the walls.

863
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:51,161
Yes, my Sultan.

864
01:25:51,281 --> 01:25:53,321
Zaganos, you will hold the Galata ridge.

865
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:54,481
Yes, my Sultan.

866
01:25:55,321 --> 01:25:56,281
Hasan.

867
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,361
You will command the veteran soldiers.

868
01:25:59,241 --> 01:26:03,161
Don't send the veterans or the cavalrymen
until we have a hole on the walls.

869
01:26:03,281 --> 01:26:04,361
Yes, my Sultan.

870
01:26:05,281 --> 01:26:06,281
You can leave now.

871
01:26:13,361 --> 01:26:16,321
He tries to test our faith...

872
01:26:17,401 --> 01:26:19,441
by starting the
siege in our holiest day.

873
01:26:21,281 --> 01:26:22,401
But this will bring him the doom...

874
01:26:23,481 --> 01:26:26,441
and bring us the salvation.

875
01:26:34,321 --> 01:26:35,321
What shall we do, sir?

876
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:38,281
Are we going to sit and watch this war?

877
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:40,401
Are we going to trust
the Turkish promises?

878
01:26:41,441 --> 01:26:43,441
Better than being
under Pope's authority.

879
01:26:44,441 --> 01:26:48,241
But yet, we should do our
best to protect our city.

880
01:26:54,241 --> 01:26:57,241
APRIL 6, 1453 FRIDAY

881
01:27:39,241 --> 01:27:40,241
Guistiniani!

882
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:42,441
I'll tell you later.

883
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:49,481
'Selamun aleykum

884
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:51,441
"Kalos antamothsikame."

885
01:27:52,321 --> 01:27:55,281
I wish I could have
hosted you in my palace...

886
01:27:55,481 --> 01:27:58,361
but you are too crowded.

887
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:02,321
Thank you for the hospitality, Emperor.

888
01:28:03,241 --> 01:28:05,321
I am here to host you in that palace.

889
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,361
I would like to remind you that...

890
01:28:07,481 --> 01:28:10,241
our walls and our faith...

891
01:28:10,361 --> 01:28:12,201
have never been
broken in history, Sultan.

892
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:15,481
You will never need to remind this
to anyone after this siege, Emperor.

893
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:20,401
My city walls heard this many times.
Last time was from your father.

894
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:24,321
But he couldn't succeed
either, just like the others.

895
01:28:25,281 --> 01:28:27,321
We came here to conclude it.

896
01:28:28,321 --> 01:28:32,321
If you give the city now, your
people and their families...

897
01:28:32,441 --> 01:28:34,441
will keep living peacefully...

898
01:28:35,281 --> 01:28:37,281
with their properties untouched.

899
01:28:37,441 --> 01:28:40,361
Then, there will be a
lot of blood. Your blood.

900
01:28:41,281 --> 01:28:43,481
We obeyed what Koran ordered.

901
01:29:17,481 --> 01:29:20,241
Shutters!

902
01:29:25,321 --> 01:29:27,281
Fire!

903
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,281
Come on!

904
01:29:30,401 --> 01:29:31,321
Fire!

905
01:29:32,361 --> 01:29:34,281
Fire!

906
01:29:47,361 --> 01:29:49,281
Go, go. Take your place.

907
01:29:51,441 --> 01:29:53,241
Shields!

908
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:55,281
Shields!

909
01:29:58,241 --> 01:30:00,401
Archers!

910
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:05,281
Shoot!

911
01:30:18,401 --> 01:30:19,441
Basilica cannon.

912
01:30:48,281 --> 01:30:49,481
You just couldn't get this Urban killed.

913
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,321
Archers!

914
01:31:10,441 --> 01:31:11,441
Shoot!

915
01:31:26,321 --> 01:31:27,361
Close this hole right now!

916
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:29,281
You, cover it with your arrows.

917
01:31:30,281 --> 01:31:32,241
And you, bring the stones. Hurry.

918
01:31:52,401 --> 01:31:53,481
Catapults!

919
01:32:06,481 --> 01:32:09,241
Faster. Come on!

920
01:33:47,361 --> 01:33:49,281
Burn it down. Kill them all!

921
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:14,441
Fill this gap!

922
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:09,321
Are you still thinking of Era, sir?

923
01:35:22,481 --> 01:35:24,401
And Ayvansaray front?

924
01:35:25,281 --> 01:35:26,401
The same, my Sultan.

925
01:35:27,401 --> 01:35:29,481
We couldn't succeed in any of the lines.

926
01:35:31,401 --> 01:35:34,401
We have heavy causalities, my Sultan.

927
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:38,321
We are trying to open the
Golden Horn front as you ordered.

928
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:40,321
But whenever we come
close to the chains...

929
01:35:40,441 --> 01:35:43,281
long ranged Greek
cannons start firing.

930
01:35:43,401 --> 01:35:45,241
Our soldiers should not wait.

931
01:35:45,361 --> 01:35:49,201
They may think we are discouraged
because we're not fighting today.

932
01:35:49,321 --> 01:35:51,321
That's exactly what I want
them to think, Zaganos.

933
01:35:51,481 --> 01:35:54,281
Tell Head Sapper Mustafa to sap faster.

934
01:35:54,401 --> 01:35:57,281
Tomorrow, they will know
why my soldiers are waiting.

935
01:36:09,441 --> 01:36:10,401
Sir.

936
01:36:13,281 --> 01:36:13,481
Report me.

937
01:36:14,281 --> 01:36:17,321
We have enough oil and tar,
your majesty. Everything is fine.

938
01:36:18,281 --> 01:36:20,281
There is no movement
in the Ottoman army.

939
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:22,441
They're trying to recover.

940
01:36:23,281 --> 01:36:26,361
They saw what kind of
a hell they fell into.

941
01:36:50,361 --> 01:36:53,201
We can't fire the Basilica
Cannon as frequent as we should.

942
01:36:53,321 --> 01:36:56,321
If this foam works and
cools it down faster...

943
01:36:57,241 --> 01:36:59,281
we can have 10 shots a day.

944
01:36:59,441 --> 01:37:00,481
Era?

945
01:37:04,281 --> 01:37:05,321
I'm dizzy.

946
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:13,321
I'm probably too tired.

947
01:37:31,441 --> 01:37:33,241
We have 9 fathoms left, sir.

948
01:37:33,361 --> 01:37:35,481
Good. I'll let the Sultan know.

949
01:37:37,481 --> 01:37:39,401
Work harder, lions.

950
01:37:41,281 --> 01:37:43,321
Almost there. Come on.

951
01:37:58,481 --> 01:38:00,241
Get out. Now.

952
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:03,321
Run! Get out! It will collapse.

953
01:38:03,441 --> 01:38:05,281
Get out! It will collapse.

954
01:38:05,481 --> 01:38:07,481
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Run!

955
01:38:09,481 --> 01:38:11,321
Selim.

956
01:38:12,321 --> 01:38:13,361
Come on. Move.

957
01:38:13,481 --> 01:38:15,401
Come on. Hurrry. Leave immediately.

958
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:21,321
- Run! Run!
<i>-  We're coming.</i>

959
01:38:27,241 --> 01:38:28,401
Sappers.

960
01:38:28,521 --> 01:38:29,241
They're here.

961
01:38:29,361 --> 01:38:31,321
They're here. The sappers are here.

962
01:38:31,441 --> 01:38:34,241
- Go back.
<i>-  Come on, run.</i>

963
01:38:34,361 --> 01:38:35,241
Come here.

964
01:38:35,361 --> 01:38:37,281
Dig it my lions. Dig it.

965
01:38:37,401 --> 01:38:39,441
Faster.

966
01:38:41,241 --> 01:38:42,481
Come on lions. Come on.

967
01:38:48,401 --> 01:38:50,401
Jump in. Counter them.

968
01:38:54,281 --> 01:38:56,241
Bring the gun powder barrels.

969
01:38:56,401 --> 01:38:58,241
Come around, quick.

970
01:39:02,481 --> 01:39:05,401
Come on sappers, dig it.

971
01:39:06,321 --> 01:39:08,281
Stop. Silence.

972
01:39:16,321 --> 01:39:18,441
Come on, faster. Come on. Come on.

973
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:21,401
They found us. Dig faster.

974
01:39:22,241 --> 01:39:23,201
- Come on.
- Move it.

975
01:39:23,321 --> 01:39:24,321
Come on, lions.

976
01:39:26,441 --> 01:39:27,401
Come on.

977
01:39:31,361 --> 01:39:32,361
They're very close.

978
01:39:37,281 --> 01:39:38,321
Faster. Faster.

979
01:39:46,361 --> 01:39:48,321
Come on lions, dig it.

980
01:39:50,321 --> 01:39:52,441
- Sir, get out.
- Selim.

981
01:39:53,241 --> 01:39:55,281
I won't leave you there, Selim.

982
01:39:55,401 --> 01:39:58,201
They reached us. Leave us and go.

983
01:39:58,321 --> 01:40:00,401
Faster. Come on.

984
01:40:01,241 --> 01:40:02,321
It's too late. Just go, master.

985
01:40:02,441 --> 01:40:03,441
Go now.

986
01:40:05,441 --> 01:40:07,361
Forgive all my sins against you.

987
01:40:10,401 --> 01:40:11,441
Run now.

988
01:40:12,321 --> 01:40:13,281
Come on.

989
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:06,401
We will not die for nothing.

990
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:12,281
(I witness there is no God but Allah

991
01:41:12,401 --> 01:41:16,321
And I witness Mohammed is
his servant and his Prophet.)

992
01:41:17,401 --> 01:41:21,081
Allah is great.

993
01:41:21,321 --> 01:41:22,441
- What's going on?
- Run.

994
01:41:23,241 --> 01:41:25,281
- (Allah is great)
<i>-  (Allah is great)</i>

995
01:41:50,401 --> 01:41:52,241
You summoned me, my Sultan.

996
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:55,401
One day while we were practicing
sword, you told me something, Hasan.

997
01:41:56,401 --> 01:41:58,361
Using a sword needs skill.

998
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:02,441
You should not hold it
too tight or too loose.

999
01:42:03,441 --> 01:42:07,361
If you hold it too tight, you get
tired right away, and can't move fast

1000
01:42:08,281 --> 01:42:12,361
If you hold it too loose, your
sword drops at the first impact.

1001
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:16,361
Now is time to hold the
sword properly, Hasan.

1002
01:42:16,481 --> 01:42:18,201
It is your turn.

1003
01:42:18,321 --> 01:42:20,361
- Get ready.
<i>-  Yes, my Sultan.</i>

1004
01:42:32,321 --> 01:42:33,401
My Sultan gave his orders.

1005
01:42:34,281 --> 01:42:35,361
Tower siege assault is tonight

1006
01:42:35,481 --> 01:42:37,241
We will get ready.

1007
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:41,241
Be careful, Hasan.

1008
01:43:03,321 --> 01:43:04,321
Archers!

1009
01:43:04,441 --> 01:43:07,321
- Archers!
- Shoot!

1010
01:43:30,481 --> 01:43:32,361
Break this door!

1011
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:46,481
Kill these dogs.

1012
01:44:26,441 --> 01:44:28,401
Come on, hurry.

1013
01:44:29,241 --> 01:44:30,321
Faster.

1014
01:44:30,481 --> 01:44:33,321
I'm telling you, faster.

1015
01:44:34,321 --> 01:44:36,441
Fill these cauldrons. Fire
the cannons more frequently.

1016
01:44:37,241 --> 01:44:38,281
Come on.

1017
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:13,361
Run! We need more archers here.

1018
01:45:16,321 --> 01:45:17,281
Burn those towers.

1019
01:45:17,401 --> 01:45:19,281
Fill these cauldrons. Come on.

1020
01:45:32,281 --> 01:45:33,441
Burn down those towers.

1021
01:45:41,281 --> 01:45:44,441
Get ready. Come on.

1022
01:45:46,361 --> 01:45:47,401
Faster.

1023
01:45:48,441 --> 01:45:50,201
Gangplank...

1024
01:45:50,321 --> 01:45:51,241
Brother!

1025
01:45:51,361 --> 01:45:52,401
Stay away!

1026
01:45:53,361 --> 01:45:55,361
Get ready to launch the gangplank.

1027
01:45:57,361 --> 01:45:59,241
Push the tower.

1028
01:46:07,321 --> 01:46:08,321
Put it.

1029
01:46:17,361 --> 01:46:19,361
We are in fire. We have to leave now.

1030
01:46:19,481 --> 01:46:20,441
Go away!

1031
01:46:21,361 --> 01:46:22,441
Faster.

1032
01:46:23,241 --> 01:46:26,281
Push it faster.

1033
01:46:34,441 --> 01:46:36,321
Burn them down. Don't
let them come closer.

1034
01:46:36,441 --> 01:46:38,361
Launch the gangplank.

1035
01:46:39,281 --> 01:46:41,401
Come on.

1036
01:46:42,241 --> 01:46:43,281
Move away.

1037
01:46:43,401 --> 01:46:45,481
Push it. Push it.

1038
01:46:46,241 --> 01:46:47,401
Come on. Fix the cannon.

1039
01:46:48,281 --> 01:46:49,201
Fire.

1040
01:47:54,321 --> 01:47:57,361
You are our heroes.

1041
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:02,481
We'll bury them all, soon enough.

1042
01:48:22,241 --> 01:48:24,241
I saw Guistiniani on the walls.

1043
01:48:25,361 --> 01:48:27,241
You are right about him.

1044
01:48:27,441 --> 01:48:29,401
He is really a capable
and dangerous knight.

1045
01:48:30,241 --> 01:48:34,241
It could have been easier to pass
over the walls if he wasn't here.

1046
01:48:35,321 --> 01:48:36,441
Be careful with him, Hasan.

1047
01:48:46,281 --> 01:48:48,241
I checked all the fronts.

1048
01:48:48,401 --> 01:48:50,441
Our loss is not too much.

1049
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:54,201
Especially when compared to Turks.

1050
01:48:54,321 --> 01:48:57,321
You were against the Latin
support, Grand Duke Notaras.

1051
01:48:57,441 --> 01:48:59,281
But as you see...

1052
01:48:59,401 --> 01:49:01,441
Turks are shattered everywhere.

1053
01:49:02,241 --> 01:49:06,201
The Pope should do more than this
to get rid of Mehmet for good.

1054
01:49:06,321 --> 01:49:09,441
We must catch his army between
the walls and the Crusaders.

1055
01:49:10,281 --> 01:49:12,241
Don't worry, your majesty.

1056
01:49:12,361 --> 01:49:15,361
Pope has already
convinced the Hungarians.

1057
01:49:29,321 --> 01:49:30,481
Leave him to us.

1058
01:49:38,441 --> 01:49:41,241
If I become a martyr
with Allah's will...

1059
01:49:41,361 --> 01:49:43,401
I'll ask a favor from you.

1060
01:49:45,441 --> 01:49:47,441
It is just an arrow. Don't
worry, it won't kill you.

1061
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:50,441
Will you do it or not...

1062
01:49:51,361 --> 01:49:52,441
tell me that.

1063
01:49:53,361 --> 01:49:55,281
Tell me. What's that favor you'll ask?

1064
01:50:01,321 --> 01:50:03,321
You'll go and see...

1065
01:50:03,441 --> 01:50:04,441
my fiance.

1066
01:50:06,241 --> 01:50:07,321
Tell her that...

1067
01:50:07,441 --> 01:50:10,241
Huseyin became a
martyr with my honor.

1068
01:50:10,441 --> 01:50:12,241
Get well soon.

1069
01:50:12,361 --> 01:50:15,481
You will tell your fiance how you
fought after we break the walls.

1070
01:50:18,361 --> 01:50:20,201
I am Ladislaus, King of Hungary.

1071
01:50:20,321 --> 01:50:22,361
My long-running regent
John Hunyadi has been

1072
01:50:22,481 --> 01:50:24,361
relinquished from his
regency by my will.

1073
01:50:24,481 --> 01:50:29,241
I inform you that the truce you
signed with him is invalid...

1074
01:50:29,361 --> 01:50:33,361
and I salute you sincerely
with my belief that...

1075
01:50:34,321 --> 01:50:36,281
you will stop the
siege as soon as possible.

1076
01:50:36,401 --> 01:50:39,241
Please don't forget the great pain...

1077
01:50:39,361 --> 01:50:42,361
we both experienced
when our armies clashed.

1078
01:50:43,281 --> 01:50:45,321
Tell your king that I will
be happy to greet him...

1079
01:50:45,441 --> 01:50:48,281
here with my army.

1080
01:50:52,321 --> 01:50:53,201
My Sultan...

1081
01:50:53,321 --> 01:50:56,321
I always told you that
this campaign was a mistake.

1082
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:58,281
We have been here for a month.

1083
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:00,401
Our army is worn out.

1084
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:02,481
If the Hungarians come...

1085
01:51:03,281 --> 01:51:04,441
This is just a threat, mentor.

1086
01:51:05,321 --> 01:51:06,281
Even if it is for real...

1087
01:51:06,401 --> 01:51:09,281
we will capture the city
before they arrive here.

1088
01:51:09,401 --> 01:51:13,361
If we can't, we will fight
with both Greeks and Hungarians

1089
01:51:13,481 --> 01:51:14,401
Now go...

1090
01:51:15,241 --> 01:51:18,241
and tell Urban that I want him
to fire his cannons more frequently.

1091
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:19,441
Yes, my Sultan.

1092
01:51:20,321 --> 01:51:22,481
- Send more archers to the Pigi gate.
- Yes, your majesty.

1093
01:51:27,281 --> 01:51:28,241
Your majesty.

1094
01:51:28,361 --> 01:51:30,281
King of Hungary kept his promise.

1095
01:51:30,401 --> 01:51:33,401
- His envoy gave his message to Mehmet.
- Good.

1096
01:51:34,241 --> 01:51:37,281
When the Hungarians arrive, we
will not only defend our city...

1097
01:51:37,481 --> 01:51:41,281
but also get rid
of the Turks forever.

1098
01:51:43,241 --> 01:51:46,401
What do you think? Do you think
we should fire it more frequently?

1099
01:51:47,321 --> 01:51:49,441
Don't worry, father. My foam will work.

1100
01:51:50,241 --> 01:51:51,241
Alright.

1101
01:51:51,361 --> 01:51:53,321
- Foreman Mahmut, put the powder in.
<i>-  Yes, sir.</i>

1102
01:51:54,361 --> 01:51:57,321
Bring some more foam for
the next shot, daughter.

1103
01:52:00,241 --> 01:52:01,361
Stretch it, guys.

1104
01:52:11,241 --> 01:52:12,201
Father!

1105
01:52:12,321 --> 01:52:14,321
- Master? Master.
<i>-  Move away.</i>

1106
01:52:17,401 --> 01:52:19,321
- Father, open your eyes.
- Fetch the doctor.

1107
01:52:23,401 --> 01:52:25,361
It is all my fault.

1108
01:52:27,321 --> 01:52:28,361
What if he died?

1109
01:52:31,401 --> 01:52:32,441
Our sultan.

1110
01:52:34,281 --> 01:52:35,361
As you were.

1111
01:52:42,481 --> 01:52:44,281
When will he be okay?

1112
01:52:44,401 --> 01:52:46,161
In a few days, my Sultan.

1113
01:52:46,281 --> 01:52:48,361
Basilica Cannon has to be fixed.

1114
01:52:49,321 --> 01:52:52,241
- He must get well as soon as possible.
- Yes, my Sultan.

1115
01:52:56,361 --> 01:52:57,321
Don't worry.

1116
01:52:57,441 --> 01:52:59,361
I will fix the Basilica Cannon.

1117
01:53:07,441 --> 01:53:08,401
Move away.

1118
01:53:10,361 --> 01:53:12,401
Release some of these...

1119
01:53:13,401 --> 01:53:15,161
so it will motivate the Turks

1120
01:53:15,281 --> 01:53:16,401
I wish we were dead.

1121
01:53:18,441 --> 01:53:19,481
Move.

1122
01:53:20,321 --> 01:53:21,361
Take him.

1123
01:53:29,281 --> 01:53:30,441
Hey! Brave Turkish soldier.

1124
01:53:33,281 --> 01:53:35,401
You must have missed your friends here.

1125
01:53:37,441 --> 01:53:38,481
You believe that...

1126
01:53:39,281 --> 01:53:41,401
you go to heaven if
you die in war field.

1127
01:53:42,401 --> 01:53:45,401
Then, let's not keep you waiting.

1128
01:53:55,321 --> 01:53:58,361
I witness that there's
no god but Allah and I...

1129
01:54:25,401 --> 01:54:27,401
Stop those ships

1130
01:54:32,481 --> 01:54:35,241
Stop them. Stop them.

1131
01:54:35,361 --> 01:54:38,201
- My sultan.
<i>-  Stop them.</i>

1132
01:54:38,321 --> 01:54:41,281
Sink them, sink them!

1133
01:54:41,401 --> 01:54:42,401
My Sultan.

1134
01:54:43,321 --> 01:54:44,321
That's enough.

1135
01:55:30,321 --> 01:55:32,441
Thank God, we devastated his armada.

1136
01:55:33,361 --> 01:55:35,401
Let's see what you will do now, Mehmet.

1137
01:55:36,441 --> 01:55:38,281
For our emperor.

1138
01:55:40,321 --> 01:55:44,321
Long live our Emperor.
Long live Constantine.

1139
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:57,241
You just couldn't stop 3 ships.

1140
01:56:01,361 --> 01:56:04,441
You haven't past over
the chains for 40 days.

1141
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:08,321
But my Sultan, the range of
their cannons prevents us from...

1142
01:56:10,281 --> 01:56:11,281
Take him out.

1143
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:13,361
Send to exile. Out, all of you.

1144
01:56:44,321 --> 01:56:45,441
Why aren't we fighting?

1145
01:57:43,401 --> 01:57:46,441
I was against this campaign
all from the beginning.

1146
01:57:47,281 --> 01:57:48,481
I said it would be our end.

1147
01:57:49,281 --> 01:57:50,361
Now look what we got.

1148
01:57:50,481 --> 01:57:53,281
You confused our Sultan.

1149
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:58,281
Our government is at the verge of falling
because of your personal ambitions.

1150
01:57:58,401 --> 01:58:02,161
Our personal ambition is
to serve our government.

1151
01:58:02,281 --> 01:58:04,161
Is this your idea of serving?

1152
01:58:04,281 --> 01:58:07,201
Everybody knows your desire
is to get my position.

1153
01:58:07,321 --> 01:58:09,361
And you count on this campaign for that.

1154
01:58:09,481 --> 01:58:11,241
You have personal
interest on this conquest.

1155
01:58:11,361 --> 01:58:13,321
Why don't we all keep calm? We should
not forget about the Hungarian menace.

1156
01:58:13,441 --> 01:58:15,481
If they come to help

1157
01:58:15,601 --> 01:58:17,761
and they might already be on their way...

1158
01:58:17,881 --> 01:58:19,201
we are all doomed.

1159
01:58:19,321 --> 01:58:21,481
We should tell our Sultan that...

1160
01:58:22,281 --> 01:58:26,201
we must immediately cease the
campaign and go back to Edirne.

1161
01:58:26,321 --> 01:58:28,241
I hope you will be beheaded.

1162
01:59:09,361 --> 01:59:11,241
The Hungarian army gas gathered.

1163
01:59:11,401 --> 01:59:13,321
They will be here any time.

1164
01:59:13,441 --> 01:59:14,281
That's right.

1165
01:59:14,401 --> 01:59:16,441
If they come, we all die.

1166
01:59:17,241 --> 01:59:19,241
Our Sultan does not leave his pavilion.

1167
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:23,281
Our Sultan is blinded. We can't pass
over the walls, no matter what we do.

1168
01:59:24,401 --> 01:59:26,281
We will die for nothing.

1169
01:59:26,401 --> 01:59:28,241
We should go back.

1170
01:59:33,401 --> 01:59:35,361
Why do you whine like a pussy?

1171
01:59:35,481 --> 01:59:37,241
Bastards!

1172
01:59:39,281 --> 01:59:40,481
Why do you eat our Sultan's bread?

1173
01:59:43,361 --> 01:59:45,441
No blood has spilled
from your sword for years.

1174
01:59:46,281 --> 01:59:49,481
Now our Sultan has opened a path to
glory for you. Is this why you treason?

1175
01:59:50,321 --> 01:59:52,161
Isn't it enough that we have been
fighting for 40 days for nothing.

1176
01:59:52,281 --> 01:59:53,321
Shut up!

1177
01:59:54,281 --> 01:59:57,481
Do you think a bunch of dogs
like you can start a mutiny?

1178
01:59:58,321 --> 02:00:00,401
Watch your words. If there
is a dog here, it must be you.

1179
02:00:05,321 --> 02:00:06,481
Now, go away.

1180
02:00:26,321 --> 02:00:28,201
Why doesn't he go back?

1181
02:00:28,321 --> 02:00:30,361
He can't accept his defeat.

1182
02:00:31,321 --> 02:00:33,481
I prefer him to be here
when the Hungarians arrive.

1183
02:00:34,321 --> 02:00:37,361
I will clean my boots with his robe.

1184
02:00:45,361 --> 02:00:47,281
Welcome, White Sheik.

1185
02:00:47,481 --> 02:00:49,281
We just had to call you.

1186
02:00:49,401 --> 02:00:52,241
He doesn't speak to anyone including us.

1187
02:00:52,401 --> 02:00:55,281
- Is he in his pavilion?
<i>-  Yes, Master White Semsettin.</i>

1188
02:00:55,441 --> 02:00:57,281
He hasn't gone out for two days.

1189
02:00:57,401 --> 02:00:59,481
Soldiers are restless.

1190
02:01:18,241 --> 02:01:19,281
My Sheik.

1191
02:01:20,441 --> 02:01:21,401
Welcome.

1192
02:01:22,281 --> 02:01:23,441
Thank you, Mehmet.

1193
02:01:26,281 --> 02:01:27,361
What's wrong with you?

1194
02:01:28,281 --> 02:01:30,241
Why doesn't your army fight?

1195
02:01:30,481 --> 02:01:32,441
We have been here for 40 days

1196
02:01:34,241 --> 02:01:37,281
Patience is the second mind to men.

1197
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:41,321
It keeps your dream, your purpose alive.

1198
02:01:42,241 --> 02:01:46,241
I know, the unsuccessful attempts...

1199
02:01:46,361 --> 02:01:51,361
have caused disappointment
in both your army and you.

1200
02:01:52,281 --> 02:01:55,281
It discouraged your soldiers.

1201
02:01:55,401 --> 02:01:59,321
And the infidels are celebrating.

1202
02:02:01,361 --> 02:02:02,401
Come on Mehmet.

1203
02:02:04,361 --> 02:02:05,441
Come with me.

1204
02:02:17,321 --> 02:02:19,241
Before I came here...

1205
02:02:19,361 --> 02:02:21,361
slept for a vision for
three nights consecutively.

1206
02:02:22,361 --> 02:02:25,481
Just to see if this campaign
is destined good or bad.

1207
02:02:26,401 --> 02:02:30,281
Thanks God, I got what
I asked for last night.

1208
02:02:31,281 --> 02:02:35,441
I saw Hazreti Eyyubi Ensari in my dream.

1209
02:02:36,441 --> 02:02:39,281
He told me where his grave is

1210
02:02:39,401 --> 02:02:41,441
He said "Go. Show it to Mehmet."

1211
02:02:42,281 --> 02:02:45,361
Tell him why I am buried
so close to the walls.

1212
02:03:03,281 --> 02:03:04,321
My Sultan.

1213
02:03:09,321 --> 02:03:11,401
With the name of Allah
who protects and forgives.

1214
02:03:30,281 --> 02:03:34,481
As you know, Hazreti Eyyupjoined
the siege of Konstaniyyah...

1215
02:03:35,401 --> 02:03:37,441
with the Moslem army.

1216
02:03:38,321 --> 02:03:40,201
He didn't leave the city walls...

1217
02:03:40,321 --> 02:03:42,361
until he died.

1218
02:03:43,321 --> 02:03:45,481
And he wasn't young like you.

1219
02:03:47,241 --> 02:03:49,281
He was old and ill

1220
02:03:52,401 --> 02:03:54,361
You can't give up, Mehmet.

1221
02:03:56,281 --> 02:03:57,201
You came here...

1222
02:03:57,321 --> 02:04:00,321
to be that heralded commander.

1223
02:04:01,321 --> 02:04:03,361
Now go and lead your army.

1224
02:04:04,321 --> 02:04:06,321
If you don't do it now...

1225
02:04:07,361 --> 02:04:10,241
you'll never be able to do it again.

1226
02:04:10,401 --> 02:04:13,441
Now come back to your senses...

1227
02:04:14,401 --> 02:04:18,241
and show everyone
your superior skills.

1228
02:04:19,441 --> 02:04:21,441
You have the power to do this.

1229
02:04:24,441 --> 02:04:25,401
Remember...

1230
02:04:26,321 --> 02:04:29,481
strong winds wuther
at steep mountains.

1231
02:04:42,321 --> 02:04:44,321
I won't go back...

1232
02:04:45,401 --> 02:04:46,481
before I take this city, father.

1233
02:05:53,441 --> 02:05:54,441
MY leg!

1234
02:05:57,241 --> 02:05:59,321
MY leg! My leg is torn!

1235
02:06:12,361 --> 02:06:14,281
Come on, plankmen, run.

1236
02:06:14,441 --> 02:06:16,281
Hold the ropes.

1237
02:06:16,441 --> 02:06:17,481
Chock the ship.

1238
02:06:46,441 --> 02:06:49,361
They have hauled the ships on
the land to the Golden Horn.

1239
02:06:49,481 --> 02:06:51,201
Listen people.

1240
02:06:51,321 --> 02:06:53,281
They have hauled the ships on
the land to the Golden Horn.

1241
02:06:53,401 --> 02:06:55,281
Show mercy, mighty Lord.

1242
02:06:55,401 --> 02:06:57,401
Just when he thought he
would accept the defeat...

1243
02:06:58,281 --> 02:07:00,481
Our people and the army
are worried, your majesty.

1244
02:07:01,321 --> 02:07:02,401
This is no good.

1245
02:07:04,281 --> 02:07:06,281
He is trying to capture Golden Horn
where the city walls are the weakest.

1246
02:07:06,401 --> 02:07:07,481
He opened another front.

1247
02:07:08,321 --> 02:07:10,241
Our ships tried to sink them...

1248
02:07:10,361 --> 02:07:13,321
but they fire cannons from
Galata to keep us out of range.

1249
02:07:13,441 --> 02:07:15,401
We have to send troops to Golden Horn.

1250
02:07:16,281 --> 02:07:18,281
They don't have cannons in their
galleys. If we deploy troops there...

1251
02:07:18,401 --> 02:07:20,401
other fronts will get weaker

1252
02:07:21,281 --> 02:07:24,161
He will make a bridge of
ships to deploy in Golden Horn.

1253
02:07:24,281 --> 02:07:25,281
That's his plan.

1254
02:07:26,321 --> 02:07:28,361
Those Hungarians just couldn't come.

1255
02:07:29,321 --> 02:07:30,361
Guistiniani.

1256
02:07:31,321 --> 02:07:33,361
Send reinforcement to the Golden Horn.

1257
02:07:34,401 --> 02:07:35,361
Notaras...

1258
02:07:36,241 --> 02:07:37,321
go find Gennadius.

1259
02:07:37,441 --> 02:07:41,321
Tell him to do everything
to keep the high spirits

1260
02:08:11,361 --> 02:08:13,241
Oh Lord, you save us.

1261
02:08:16,281 --> 02:08:19,241
Our emperor asks a favor from you.

1262
02:08:19,441 --> 02:08:22,441
A man who subdues Pope
can't be my emperor.

1263
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:24,281
For God's sake.

1264
02:08:24,401 --> 02:08:26,321
You know I feel the same.

1265
02:08:26,481 --> 02:08:29,201
But you have to help us
in these troubled days.

1266
02:08:29,321 --> 02:08:32,281
People are in terror. There is chaos.

1267
02:08:33,241 --> 02:08:34,401
You think I don't know this?

1268
02:08:35,481 --> 02:08:38,281
You should use your
influence on the people.

1269
02:08:39,281 --> 02:08:41,481
I'm already doing that despite of you.

1270
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:44,401
But you sold Orthodox
people to the Catholics.

1271
02:08:45,281 --> 02:08:47,321
And after all those holy signs...

1272
02:08:47,441 --> 02:08:49,281
the faith in our people...

1273
02:08:49,401 --> 02:08:52,241
is gone just like the
light in Hagia Sophia.

1274
02:08:53,401 --> 02:08:54,481
People are desperate.

1275
02:09:07,241 --> 02:09:08,321
My soldiers.

1276
02:09:09,441 --> 02:09:12,441
We have a glorious history.

1277
02:09:13,441 --> 02:09:16,361
We conquered many
strong forts and cities.

1278
02:09:17,281 --> 02:09:18,361
We passed high mountains.

1279
02:09:20,241 --> 02:09:23,321
We broke the javelins...

1280
02:09:24,281 --> 02:09:27,281
which our enemies
hold against our chests.

1281
02:09:28,241 --> 02:09:31,441
We teared down the enemy ﬂags
which were planted in vanity.

1282
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:36,401
We died and suffered
for the sake of glow.

1283
02:09:38,481 --> 02:09:39,441
Today...

1284
02:09:40,321 --> 02:09:41,401
it is our duty...

1285
02:09:42,361 --> 02:09:45,441
to prove that we are
worthy of our forefathers.

1286
02:09:46,441 --> 02:09:48,281
Remember!

1287
02:09:49,241 --> 02:09:51,441
Glow is achieved with faith.

1288
02:09:53,361 --> 02:09:57,321
I know we will pass over
these walls with our courage

1289
02:09:59,441 --> 02:10:01,361
Tomorrow...

1290
02:10:02,281 --> 02:10:06,481
we will wake up for a happy morning
no other God's servant has seen.

1291
02:10:07,401 --> 02:10:09,321
We won't become martyrizes...

1292
02:10:09,441 --> 02:10:13,321
before we bring our
enemies to their kneels.

1293
02:10:14,481 --> 02:10:16,441
God is great!

1294
02:10:17,241 --> 02:10:18,441
God is great!

1295
02:10:40,281 --> 02:10:41,361
I was looking for you.

1296
02:10:57,401 --> 02:10:59,321
We will achieve victory tomorrow.

1297
02:11:00,281 --> 02:11:01,401
You will see, we will do it.

1298
02:11:04,281 --> 02:11:06,321
And your evenge will be taken, Era

1299
02:11:31,361 --> 02:11:32,401
Hasan.

1300
02:11:59,361 --> 02:12:02,441
MAY 29,1453 TUESDAY

1301
02:12:32,321 --> 02:12:33,281
Today...

1302
02:12:34,241 --> 02:12:35,441
he will try his strongest assault.

1303
02:12:36,361 --> 02:12:37,441
If we can fend it off...

1304
02:12:38,441 --> 02:12:40,201
this war will finish.

1305
02:12:40,321 --> 02:12:43,321
Don't worry. Your people
will celebrate your victory.

1306
02:13:13,401 --> 02:13:14,401
That's all of it, sir.

1307
02:13:17,241 --> 02:13:19,281
You couldn't find us
this time, the reptiles.

1308
02:13:19,481 --> 02:13:21,441
Sir, I am pouring the
powder to the exit.

1309
02:13:22,401 --> 02:13:24,241
Sir?

1310
02:13:27,241 --> 02:13:28,401
I don't want any mistakes.

1311
02:13:29,241 --> 02:13:30,281
Cabuk cikin.

1312
02:13:51,441 --> 02:13:53,321
Fire!

1313
02:13:58,321 --> 02:14:01,281
Attack!

1314
02:14:09,321 --> 02:14:11,481
They broke down the wall!
They broke down the wall!

1315
02:14:17,361 --> 02:14:20,361
- Run.
<i>-  They got in.</i>

1316
02:14:49,241 --> 02:14:52,321
They broke down the Romanos wall, your
majesty. You have to get out of here.

1317
02:14:53,441 --> 02:14:55,241
We have to go back to the palace.

1318
02:14:55,401 --> 02:14:58,241
You should stay in a safe
place until we repel them.

1319
02:16:07,481 --> 02:16:09,241
Remember you told me...

1320
02:16:09,361 --> 02:16:11,441
to tell your fiancé.

1321
02:16:13,241 --> 02:16:14,361
And you go to my family...

1322
02:16:17,281 --> 02:16:18,241
I will.

1323
02:16:18,361 --> 02:16:20,441
I will let them know you became
an martyr with your honor.

1324
02:16:22,361 --> 02:16:23,441
HuSeyin!

1325
02:16:26,361 --> 02:16:28,361
To the ﬂag tower.

1326
02:17:36,401 --> 02:17:38,281
You will have a painful death...

1327
02:17:38,401 --> 02:17:40,281
but nobody will know it.

1328
02:17:40,401 --> 02:17:42,241
History don't tell about the losers

1329
02:17:42,361 --> 02:17:44,321
We never forget the martyrs.

1330
02:17:44,441 --> 02:17:48,281
But today you will die and
nobody will remember you.

1331
02:22:11,241 --> 02:22:13,441
Run. Go to Hagia Sophia.

1332
02:22:18,401 --> 02:22:20,241
People and the army...

1333
02:22:20,401 --> 02:22:24,321
believe that our
God given holy light...

1334
02:22:24,441 --> 02:22:26,401
is taken back to Heaven.

1335
02:22:28,361 --> 02:22:31,321
You have to leave the
city, your majesty.

1336
02:22:33,401 --> 02:22:35,321
Our holy light...

1337
02:22:40,401 --> 02:22:43,361
was taken to Heaven long ago.

1338
02:22:45,441 --> 02:22:47,361
At least I should fight...

1339
02:22:48,241 --> 02:22:50,241
for my honor to the end.

1340
02:26:19,241 --> 02:26:20,361
Your emperor is dead.

1341
02:26:23,281 --> 02:26:24,321
You are under arrest.

1342
02:26:37,361 --> 02:26:40,361
Long live the Sultan.

1343
02:26:42,361 --> 02:26:45,361
Long live the Sultan.

1344
02:26:49,401 --> 02:26:50,401
Stand up.

1345
02:26:54,321 --> 02:26:57,281
Bury your emperor due to your religion.

1346
02:28:23,321 --> 02:28:24,401
Don't worry.

1347
02:28:27,361 --> 02:28:29,321
From now on, your lives...

1348
02:28:31,241 --> 02:28:32,321
your property...

1349
02:28:33,361 --> 02:28:34,481
and your destiny
are a part of us, too.

1350
02:28:43,401 --> 02:28:47,481
You are free to live
according to your own faith.
