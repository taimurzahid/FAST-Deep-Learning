1
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:49,282
'Company...halt!'

2
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:10,737
Hitler! Hitler!

3
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:31,885
<i>Munich. November 9th, 1923.</i>

4
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,555
<i>Opposed by government forces</i>

5
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:38,825
<i>Adolf Hitler's visionary ideas
of overthrowing</i>

6
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,794
<i>the Weimar Republic,
and establishing himself</i>

7
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,964
<i>as dictator ended abruptly
in his arrest</i>

8
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,499
<i>and conviction for treason.</i>

9
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:49,568
<i>During his imprisonment
in Landsberg fortress</i>

10
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:52,471
<i>Hitler laid down
the malevolent presets</i>

11
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,840
<i>which were
to guide Nazi Germany.</i>

12
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:58,911
<i>A ruthless blueprint
for political rape, genocide</i>

13
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:03,482
<i>and world conquest unequalled
in the history of mankind.</i>

14
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:08,087
'Unremittingly, we shall poison
the relations'

15
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:12,358
'between the people
and states of all countries.'

16
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:17,563
By envy and hatred,
by struggle and warfare..

17
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,300
...and by spreading hunger,
destitution and plagues

18
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,170
we shall bring all people
to such a pass..

19
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:29,775
...that the only escape
will lie in total submission

20
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,478
to our domination.

21
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,514
<i>Shall I read it back, my Fuhrer?</i>

22
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,915
No.

23
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:39,151
But, some of the language
might be a bit too strong.

24
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:45,557
Abel, you still don't understand
the purpose of this book.

25
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:48,227
I have no desire to give comfort
to the church goers

26
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:53,433
the believers in democracy,
the crooked legged Jew vermin.

27
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,434
To the parasitic scum
who infest Germany

28
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,137
this will be a warning.

29
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:01,507
But a warning that
they will never accept.

30
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:02,941
No.

31
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:05,845
<i>Mein Kampf is for those
who will follow me.</i>

32
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,113
They will read it.

33
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:10,215
Believe it.
Act upon it.

34
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,984
<i>'Mein Fuhrer!'</i>

35
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,423
Now, I have been listening
to that drivel

36
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,626
for the last two days.

37
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,366
'You must think you are
Caesar, Napoleon and Bismarck'

38
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,735
huh, all rolled up in one.

39
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,671
They must've made a mistake
when they put you in here.

40
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:36,208
This is a prison.
Not a mental institution.

41
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,344
What is your name?

42
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,547
Oh, so you can have me shot
when you become

43
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,316
the lord of Germany.

44
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,687
It is Joseph Schonberg.

45
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,754
Lousy Jew!

46
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,567
There's not one drop
of Jewish blood in me.

47
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,637
But you don't have to be a Jew
to hold your nose

48
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:08,808
at the sewage pouring out
of this imitation messiah.

49
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:13,379
The German people still
believe in law and in order.

50
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:17,016
Here's a perfect example
of what I just told you.

51
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,620
The world will not
accept my warning.

52
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:23,690
Even when they hear it,
they won't believe it.

53
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,259
They will be shouting
the phrases about

54
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:31,030
decadent democracy as they are
led to the slaughter.

55
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,110
<i>Released from Landsberg fortress</i>

57
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,614
<i>Hitler immediately plunged

59
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:56,221
<i>would enable him to achieve
his megalomaniac ambitions.</i>

60

<i>By 1928, tens of thousands,

<i>hypnotic fanaticism,
had adopted Mein Kampf</i>

62

<i>as the Bible
of national socialism</i>

63
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:09,768
<i>and Hitler as their savior.</i>

64
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,238
<i>For his disciples,
Hitler selected those</i>

65
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:17,309
<i>who like himself, were among

<i>Crippled in mind and body,

<i>in the unbalanced world

68
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,556
<i>Among them were Herman Goering,

<i>Ernst Rohm, a sadistic pervert</i>

<i>Heinrich Himmler, sinister,

<i>the party's violent activities</i>

78
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,124

<i>of Berchtesgaden, near the
border of his native Austria.</i>

81

<i>To act as housekeeper

82

<i>Angelika Raubal.</i>

84

Angelika.

85
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,613
I often hoped we would
see each other again.

86
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,516
And then your wonderful
telegram came.

87
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:33,786
You should have seen my friends
in Vienna when they found out

88
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,354
we were coming to live with you.

89
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:37,856
So, they were impressed, huh?

90
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:42,762
Impressed? All Austria
is talking about you.

91
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:48,133
'This is Friedl, your niece.'

92
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,536
Hello, uncle.

93
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,071
I didn't mention it
in my telegram.

94
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:56,342
But I really couldn't
leave them alone in Vienna.

95
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:59,946
Of course not. Them?

96
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,186
You have been fooling
with the travelling case

97
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,523
ever since we left Vienna.

98
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,493
Are you going to sit and laugh
like a silly goose all day?

99
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:17,497
Pick up your clothing.

100
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,298
I haven't said hello
to Uncle Adolph yet.

101
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:22,502
Hello, Uncle Adolph.

102
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,810
You know, my travelling cases
don't seem to hold

103
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:34,547
as much as they used to.

104
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,949
Even when they are
so carefully packed?

105
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:40,953
Adolph, you must not
encourage her.

106
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,522
She will take advantage of you.

107
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,526
'You mentioned
a house in your telegram.'

108
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,729
But I didn't expect
anything like this.

109
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:56,002
'Girls, look at it.'

110
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:02,274
It's just beautiful.

111
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,511
I think you had better
let Emil carry your bag.

112
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,079
Emil.

113
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,884
Oh, Uncle Adolph,
please show us the house.

114
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,312
<i>- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!</i>

115
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,783
Gentlemen..

116
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,391
Freidl and I were just doing
the spring cleaning.

117
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,626
Adolph didn't tell me
he was expecting you.

118
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:56,195
We didn't make an appointment.

119
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:59,264
However, it is necessary
that we speak with him.

120
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,933
But he isn't home.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,303
He and Geli left early
this morning for a picnic.

122
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,172
Do you know where they might be?

123
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,142
They have several
favorite places.

124
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,311
If you gentlemen will make
yourselves comfortable

125
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,781
I will send Friedl
to look for them.

126
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,890
<i>I still think we should have
telephoned the Fuhrer first.</i>

127
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:26,925
No. This is too important.

128
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:30,028
Do you realize he only made
six speeches in the last year?

129
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:31,864
We are fighting
for our political life.

130
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,499
And you cannot win a campaign
by communing with nature

131
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:35,834
on a mountain top.

132
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,237
That depends on the campaign.

133
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,930
I hope you're not going
to put that one on the album.

134
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,266
Why not?
It's charming.

135
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,772
But overexposed.

136
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,183
For a moment, you reminded me
of someone.

137
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,020
A woman?

138
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:33,058
My mother.

139
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:35,794
When I was a boy, we used
to picnic alongside

140
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,262
a little stream.

141
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,231
Outside Linz.

142
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:44,636
She'd raise her skirt,
just as you did

143
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,173
'to keep it from getting wet.'

144
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,876
And I thought you were going
to reveal the details of some

145
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:55,247
secret love affair.

146
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,418
You better put on your shoes
and stockings.

147
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:03,455
You might catch a cold.

148
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:07,093
No, no, Uncle Alf.
This feels so good.

149
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,501
This mountain air makes me
so hungry.

150
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:20,105
I'll have to go on a diet
before I return to Vienna.

151
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,875
Why do you want
to go back to Vienna?

152
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,845
Well, I do miss the city.

153
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,315
But I thought you were
happy here with me.

154
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,316
Oh, I am, Uncle Alf.

155
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,184
It's just that I miss
the nightlife.

156
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:36,388
The theatres, the shops,
the dancing.

157
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,658
And Kort Linden.

158
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,675
You haven't mentioned him
for some time.

159
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:52,671
There's really nothing
much to say.

160
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,174
He's in Vienna and I'm here.

161
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,009
He's been writing
to you every week

162
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,944
at the Berchtesgaden
post office.

163
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,580
Emil was told when
one of your letters was given

164
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,348
to him by mistake.

165
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,717
And I practically did
everything but kiss that

166
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:10,188
fat-headed postmaster,
so he wouldn't say anything.

167
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,591
Mama would have
a fit if she knew.

168
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:14,793
What about this Kort?

169
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,295
But you know,
I'm not seeing him.

170
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:20,098
Geli, you're avoiding
my question.

171
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,334
That sounds just like mama.

172
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,070
Has she been talking
to you about Kort?

173
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,306
Mothers can be
a problem sometimes.

174
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:32,978
Geli, I am you uncle.
I'm responsible for you.

175
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,047
Surely, you have nothing
to hide from me

176
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:38,049
between you and Kort.

177
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:41,052
But that's something personal.

178
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:43,889
If you won't tell me then
I should have to insist

179
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,359
that he stop writing to you.

180
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,829
I don't think that Kort would
give me up that easily.

181
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:54,632
Then, I will have to see
that he does.

182
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:57,102
Uncle Alf, you're jealous.

183
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,198
My mother, always my mother.

184
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:31,370
'Uncle Adolph. Geli.'

185
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:40,613
'Uncle Adolph! Geli!'

186
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,465
Oh, Uncle Adolph, they are-

187
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,672
Is Uncle Adolf angry?

188
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:11,176
Friedl..

189
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:15,013
...do you remember the picture
of Uncle Adolf's mother?

190
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,183
- The one mama showed us?
- Yes.

191
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,152
Is she wearing anything
around her neck?

192
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:24,756
A pendant or a necklace?

193
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,225
No, not a necklace.

194
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:30,262
It's a cameo and a gold chain.

195
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,900
'Geli, what is it?'

196
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,102
Nothing, help me
with the things.

197
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,249
<i>The Fuhrer is coming.</i>

198
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:05,497
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

199
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:09,434
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

200
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,071
Well, I thought I had made
my position quiet clear

201
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,606
about visitors.

202
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:19,277
I did not come here to
exchange social amenities.

203
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:22,247
Your presence is needed in
Munich for the coming election.

204
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,950
As lead of the party
in the north, I insist.

205
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,153
- Insist?
- The party will demand it.

206
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,596
Listen to this
and don't you ever forget it.

207
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,898
I am the party!

208
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,433
<i>'Mein Fuhrer.'</i>

209
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:45,904
We have all worked too hard
and sacrificed too much

210
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,639
to let the movement
disintegrate.

211
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,609
What I am doing here is more
important to the future

212
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:55,380
of the party than any political
activity I might undertake.

213
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,249
The second volume of Mein Kampf

214
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,018
will be the corner stone
of a new Germany

215
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:02,588
which will last
for a thousand years!

216
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,694
<i>But my, Fuhrer, surely you could
continue with this</i>

217
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,562
most important work in Munich.

218
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:12,798
No.

219
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,667
I shall remain here
until it is completed.

220
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,070
<i>- 'But my Fuhrer--'
- 'My decision is final.'</i>

221
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,276
Gentlemen,
my mother has prepared

222
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,545
something to eat
in the dining room.

223
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:41,326
'Geli..'

224
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,670
Geli, you must not be angry.

225
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,272
I am not angry.

226
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,608
I just don't understand.

227
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:01,480
Geli, I..

228
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,317
I have no explanation.

229
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,660
Give me the cameo.

230
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,497
I will take it to Munich
and have it repaired.

231
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:25,370
No, we will go to Munich
together and shop for a new one.

232
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,006
- When? Today?
- Right after lunch.

233
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,108
I will hurry and get ready.

234
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,711
Oh, Geli. Help Friedl serve.

235
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,146
I can't. I have to pack.

236
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:37,349
'I go to Munich
with Uncle Adolf.'

237
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,588
Eat gentlemen.

238
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,259
We must leave immediately
for Munich.

239
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,383
<i>- Sieg.
- Heil.</i>

240
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,218
<i>- Sieg.
- Heil.</i>

241
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:49,188
<i>- Sieg.
- Heil.</i>

242
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,386
<i>Perhaps we should ask
the Fuhrer's permission.</i>

243
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,589
Oh, he won't mind.

244
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,696
They make a handsome couple,
don't they?

245
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,135
<i>I doubt that the Fuhrer would
express his appreciation.</i>

246
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,404
Who is the young man
she is dancing with?

247
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,575
No idea.
But I may as well find out.

248
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,844
<i>I am sure the Fuhrer
will be interested.</i>

249
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:50,749
If my figures are correct

250
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,418
we are now the second largest
party in Germany.

251
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:57,322
6.5 million votes,
107 seats in the Reichstag.

252
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,557
Strasser..

253
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,559
Reichstag is not
an end in itself

254
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,260
but merely the means to an end.

255
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:06,097
We win seats in order that we
may do away with the Reichstag.

256
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,901
That we have won today is merely
another weapon in our battle.

257
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:11,269
Call it whatever you will.

258
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:13,037
I believe we won
a great victory.

259
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:15,874
We should save the word victory,
until we achieve our goal.

260
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,075
Until then we should use
the word fight.

261
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:21,913
Next election will not be a race
for seats in the Reichstag

262
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,884
but my campaign for the
presidency against Hindenburg.

263
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:38,329
Lieutenant Erich Faber,
of Gerling staff.

264
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:41,799
Adolf, sit down.
This is disgraceful.

265
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:44,803
Strasser, if you have any
misgivings about my conduct

266
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,872
I suggest that you
keep them to yourself.

267
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:51,375
Not if you insist on submitting
the party to ridicule.

268
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:52,677
'The party has nothing
whatsoever'

269
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,546
'to do with my personal life.'

270
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:59,350
<i>Fuhrer, you can disassociate
one from the other.</i>

271
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:00,885
Your relationship with Geli

272
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,222
is a subject of common
gossip through Munich.

273
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,090
How dare you!

274
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:09,560
Our relationship has been
solely that of uncle to niece.

275
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:12,530
Then you have compromised
her, needlessly.

276
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,567
Maintaining her alone in your
apartment for the last year.

277
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,869
We may occupy the same apartment

278
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,138
but we do not share
the same bedroom.

279
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,341
If that's true, then I suggest
you either marry her

280
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,042
or send her back to her mother.

281
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:28,279
Strasser, you have gone too far,
there is no room for

282
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:32,951
a petty bourgeois moralist in
the National Social Party.

283
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,953
I shall not tolerate
any further discussion

284
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,356
about my relationship with Geli.

285
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,027
I am afraid you will
still hear about it.

286
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:45,330
Whether you like it or not.

287
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:49,501
Not even you can order
an ugly rumor like this

288
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,703
to stop from circulating.

289
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,123
That will be all, lieutenant.

290
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:13,892
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

291
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:21,600
Get your wrap.

292
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:26,738
But the evening has just begun.
I'd like to stay and dance.

293
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:31,076
The lieutenant will be occupied
with other duties.

294
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,046
<i>'Achtung!'</i>

295
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,881
<i>- 'Heil Hitler.'
- Heil Hitler.</i>

296
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:40,552
<i>- 'Heil Hitler.'
- Heil Hitler.</i>

297
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,734
What an evening.

298
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:59,370
I wish you would win
elections more often.

299
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:04,609
And if you just wouldn't
get so angry about things.

300
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,880
How long have you known him?

301
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:13,518
'Lieutenant Faber, the man
with whom you danced tonight.'

302
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,722
Oh, is that his name?
I forgot to ask.

303
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,994
I just happened to think
of his face

304
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,830
when he brought me back
to the table.

305
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:29,000
You frightened that poor boy
out of his wits.

306
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:33,471
Well, he should have
asked for my permission.

307
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,673
He didn't even ask for mine.

308
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,009
I practically kidnapped him.

309
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,011
He didn't know
what was happening

310
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,781
until he found himself
dancing with me.

311
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:50,555
Anyway, I didn't think
you'd notice me.

312
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,857
you were so busy with
Herr Strasser.

313
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,125
Strasser..

314
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:58,897
...is determined to be
the conscience of the party.

315
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:01,132
Do you know that
he actually accused us

316
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:03,568
of living immorally?

317
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:11,109
Did you tell him
the intimate details?

318
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,111
No, Geli.

319
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,150
Well..

320
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,852
Strasser needn't worry
about you seducing me.

321
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,689
I can't even get you to
help me with my buttons.

322
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:27,792
Please, Uncle.
The top one is difficult.

323
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,768
I wonder what made him bring up
the subject in the first place.

324
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,775
Strange...you have
never even kissed me.

325
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:49,947
Haven't you opened it yet?

326
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:52,317
It is open..

327
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:57,856
...Geli.

328
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:23,401
- 'You despise me.'
- No, I don't.

329
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:27,371
- 'I can see it in your eyes.'
- You are wrong.

330
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:29,374
Don't lie to me.

331
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:42,353
Perhaps, it would be better
for both of us

332
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,322
if I return to Vienna.

333
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,424
No, you will remain here.

334
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:52,030
But you know there can
never be anything between us.

335
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,933
Please, let me go
back to Vienna.

336
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,403
I can start
my music lessons again.

337
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,038
Is that all?

338
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:03,174
And what about Kort Linden?

339
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,610
We haven't written to
each other since I came

340
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:07,111
to Munich a year ago.

341
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,181
I am sure you haven't
forgotten each other.

342
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,351
Picking up that cheap affair
where you left off

343
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,185
will be no problem.

344
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:19,757
Whatever there was between Kort
and myself was not cheap.

345
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:23,428
You filthy slut!

346
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:27,165
What-what about those weekends
you spent with him in Linz?

347
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:34,639
They were wonderful.

348
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,907
Kort made me feel like a woman.

349
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:39,743
Something you would never
be capable of doing.

350
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,713
Why, you never loved me.

351
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,715
You never loved any woman.

352
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,150
You couldn't. Your mother.

353
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,987
- Always your mother.
- Damn your vile mouth!

354
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,555
You can't live with the
knowledge of your shame.

355
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:55,292
So you have tried to bury
it in distractive hatred.

356
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,329
Hatred for the world, for life,
for yourself!

357
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:02,033
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

358
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:05,270
<i>The Fuhrer has struck
a blow for freedom.</i>

359
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,905
But you'll never
be free. Never!

360
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,940
You'll see her image
in every woman's face

361
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:12,210
'just as you
saw it in mine tonight.'

362
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,479
No. No, no!

363
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:18,182
These things were never
meant to cloth me.

364
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,152
You were dressing
the nightmare in your mind.

365
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,320
Look at me.

366
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:27,158
I dare you to look at me
and tell me who you see.

367
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:31,396
'And Strasser is worried
about our relationship.'

368
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,066
I wonder how he'd really
feel if he knew

369
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:39,103
<i>the mighty Fuhrer
was less than a man.</i>

370
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,134
Good morning, Emil, Himmler.

371
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:14,873
Please, won't you come in?

372
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:20,577
Good morning Geli,
you look pale.

373
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:22,547
I didn't sleep well.

374
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,348
Unc..

375
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,952
<i>The Fuhrer isn't here.
He left early this morning.</i>

376
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:36,661
I-I was just packing.

377
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:39,797
I'm going home, to Vienna.

378
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:43,201
'If you want to wait,
make yourselves comfortable.'

379
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,471
You'll excuse me, while I pack.

380
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,641
There is some wine in the..

381
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:56,915
No, Emil.

382
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:02,220
Don't..

383
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:07,724
Please, let me telephone
Uncle Adolf.

384
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,928
Let me talk to him.

385
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:58,276
Suicide?

386
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:01,345
Did she leave a note?

387
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,582
<i>Yes. Yes, I'll inform
the Furher.</i>

388
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,993
<i>My Fuhrer, I have bad news.</i>

389
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:23,467
- What is it?
- Geli is dead.

390
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,136
'Himmler and Maurice
just found her body.'

391
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:28,872
'The gun is
still in her hand.'

392
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:32,876
No. No.

393
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:35,380
No, it-it can't be true.

394
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:39,817
Not my Geli.

395
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:43,487
Why did she do this to me?

396
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,958
Geli. Oh, my Geli.

397
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,546
I'm sorry.

398
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,816
Strasser, perhaps you had better

399
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:15,419
take care of
the necessary arrangements.

400
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,488
I think you had better leave.

401
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:19,824
<i>I'll stay here with the Fuhrer.</i>

402
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:40,878
Heinrich, Strasser should be
there in a few minutes.

403
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,980
Be careful.

404
00:34:43,046 --> 00:34:48,018
<i>The Fuhrer? The Fuhrer's
grief is overwhelming.</i>

405
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:51,355
But I'm sure he will recover.

406
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,423
You almost had Strasser
in tears.

407
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,894
And for a minute I thought you
were going to use that gun.

408
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:04,201
What do you mean? If Strasser
hadn't stop me, I would have.

409
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:07,905
She's the only woman
I have ever loved.

410
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:12,310
Her death is the greatest
loss I shall ever suffer.

411
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:16,980
But then, why did you order
Himmler and Maurice to kill her?

412
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:19,883
You wouldn't understand.

413
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,020
No one would.

414
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,222
But Geli knew.

415
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,794
It was either her life or mine.

416
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:53,684
Anna, the patients gone?

417
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,888
Yes, doctor.
But they looked quite upset.

418
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,465
Why can't he make appointments
like any normal person?

419
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:10,267
Because my dear Anna,
our patient

420
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,371
is not exactly a normal person.

421
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,375
Oedipus complex,
megalomania, impotency.

422
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,377
Any one of these psychic
disturbances could comprise

423
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,846
a case history in itself.

424
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:25,215
Anna, see if
the side door is open.

425
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:27,418
Yes, doctor.

426
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:41,231
Is anyone else in the office,
beside the doctor?

427
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:42,566
No.

428
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,802
And you stay out
of the doctor's office.

429
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,873
<i>My Fuhrer.</i>

430
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,919
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

431
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:12,095
Well, how does
your patient look?

432
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:13,797
Frankly, quite exhausted.

433
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,600
I imagine your last campaign for

434
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,534
the presidency
must have been strenuous.

435
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:20,371
Running against
Hindenburg wasn't easy.

436
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:23,574
That swine Strasser..

437
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,243
...resigned just when
I needed him most.

438
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,380
But you did get over
13 million votes

439
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,116
and 230 seats of Reichstag.

440
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:35,119
That should at least ensure
your appointment as chancellor.

441
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,754
No, it's only a matter of days.

442
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,556
But I did not come here
to discuss politics.

443
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:44,628
You know what is bothering me
those damn nightmares!

444
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,865
- I can't sleep.
- Yes, I know.

445
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,937
- What are you writing?
- 'Merely the date.'

446
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:57,608
January 20th, 1933.

447
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,546
It's been quite sometime
since I've last seen you.

448
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,415
The future chancellor of Germany

449
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,684
reduced to a case history.

450
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:12,456
It is quite confidential.
I assure you.

451
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,759
And quite useless.

452
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:21,866
What do I think of my parents,
my brother, my sister's room?

453
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,635
<i>Du scheinst.</i>

454
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,639
What has all this got
to do with my nightmares?

455
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:34,011
As I have indicated in the past,
the patient's background

456
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:37,948
is often the only clue
to his traumatic disturbances.

457
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:41,585
But this has been going on
for almost two years.

458
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:43,787
You have dragged things from me

459
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,958
that no other
living being has ever known.

460
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:50,861
Would you like to
remove your hat and coat?

461
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,396
No.

462
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:58,502
Now, you began to
suffer from these nightmares

463
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:02,873
shortly after the tragic
loss of your niece.

464
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,878
That has nothing to do with it.

465
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:23,126
Take this.

466
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:25,896
What good are they?

467
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:30,334
If these nightmares don't stop,
it will be the end of me.

468
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,036
The end of everything.

469
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:35,339
I'm afraid there's
little I can do

470
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,242
unless you are
willing to cooperate.

471
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,244
How much longer am I expected to

472
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,680
continue with
this-this nonsense?

473
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:45,982
The length of the treatment,
usually depends upon

474
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:49,353
the patient's willingness
to face the facts.

475
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:51,154
- 'In your case, Geli--'
- I told you.

476
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:54,525
That has nothing whatsoever
to do with my nightmares.

477
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,460
You must let me be
the judge of what is pertinent.

478
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:58,929
As your physician--

479
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:02,899
And there will be
no more confessions.

480
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:07,605
I refuse to tolerate your
morbid curiosity any longer.

481
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:13,144
And you had better destroy that.

482
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:35,799
My secretary will contact you.

483
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,002
Be prepared to come to Berlin.

484
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:10,300
Finally, we have arrived.
Chancellor of Germany.

485
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:14,071
- Now, we begin.
- Yeah!

486
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,154
London, Paris, Washington.

487
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,290
International Jewish conspiracy.

488
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,893
This criticism is intolerable.

489
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:38,161
<i>But mein Fuhrer,
it is impossible</i>

490
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:40,797
to restrict the activities
of the foreign press.

491
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,267
But you can prevent this poison

492
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,502
from being distributed
in Germany.

493
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,370
The opposition
press within Germany

494
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:48,638
is publishing the same story.

495
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:51,408
Then they must be silenced!

496
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:55,145
We may not be able to suppress
word and opinion but I shall not

497
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:58,682
tolerate any criticism
of our policies at home.

498
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,952
- There have been arrests.
- And acquittals.

499
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:04,588
My liberal judges
and democratic courts

500
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:08,291
they too must be eliminated.

501
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:10,494
I can't move in any direction.

502
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:15,032
President Hindenburg above me,
Vice Chancellor Von Papen below.

503
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,968
Only three seats
in a cabinet of ten.

504
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,670
When a cabinet doesn't restrict
me, the Reichstag does.

505
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:23,073
I am encircled and entrapped!

506
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,211
This opposition must
end once and for all!

507
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:28,879
'Simple.'

508
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,681
Just give me three days
and a free hand

509
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:34,251
with my brown-shirts.

510
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,919
You shall have it.

511
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:40,390
The time has come
for heads to roll.

512
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:41,825
Wherever we find them.

513
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:44,661
In the courts,
the press, the Reichstag

514
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,930
the trade unions,
the churches--

515
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:52,069
<i>Mein Fuhrer, but people are
religiously inclined.</i>

516
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,903
Perhaps we should refrain
from activities

517
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:57,807
against the church,
at this time.

518
00:42:57,874 --> 00:43:02,145
One is either a German or
a Christian, you can't be both.

519
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:05,683
The symbol of our religion is
not the cross, but the swastika.

520
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,788
As for worship,
let the people look to me.

521
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,590
I am their father.

522
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,859
<i>Mein Fuhrer, your position
as our true</i>

523
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,828
spiritual leader
is unquestionable.

524
00:43:18,895 --> 00:43:21,265
But don't you think
it may be a bit premature

525
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:24,534
to incur the antagonism
of religious groups?

526
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:27,771
Antagonism?

527
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,240
Ernst, there will
be no exceptions.

528
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:37,348
And the justifications
for these corrective measures?

529
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:46,690
The action which you have
held in reserve

530
00:43:46,756 --> 00:43:49,193
for just such an occasion.

531
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,538
Arrangements have been
complete for some time.

532
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:04,375
The only question will be when?

533
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,316
Tonight.

534
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:14,751
<i>Mein Fuhrer,
under the circumstances</i>

535
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,421
perhaps we should
cancel our dinner party.

536
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,155
Not at all.

537
00:44:19,222 --> 00:44:21,391
It will be ideal
to have the press

538
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,361
for after dinner cocktails.

539
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:28,132
The view from your window
should be excellent.

540
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,668
<i>- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

541
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,969
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

542
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:34,672
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

543
00:44:41,497 --> 00:44:43,447
The clerk from the
photographer is here.

544
00:44:43,513 --> 00:44:45,348
with certain pictures
for Herr Goebbels

545
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:46,950
Have her come in.

546
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,085
The pictures of
the inauguration ceremony.

547
00:44:49,152 --> 00:44:51,288
I need one
for a special release.

548
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:59,797
<i>- Heil Hitler.
- Bring them over here.</i>

549
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,716
All of these feature Hindenburg.

550
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,919
- I'll have them retouched.
- Hmm.

551
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:27,991
'I suppose you have seen
these pictures.'

552
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,761
Fraulein.

553
00:45:32,695 --> 00:45:34,832
Which do you prefer?

554
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:43,474
This one.

555
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:46,976
Why?

556
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:50,414
Well, it's-it's masculine.

557
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,484
I think it will appeal to women.

558
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,487
At least, it does to me.

559
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,758
I think she is right.
Use this one.

560
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:05,195
Ah there are some corrections
to be made. I'll call later.

561
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,466
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

562
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,409
<i>Mein Fuhrer, your car is ready.</i>

563
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,526
Uh, by the way, what was
that young lady's name?

564
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:40,597
Uh, Braun.
Eva Braun.

565
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:44,201
Arrange for her to be my guest
at the dinner party tonight.

566
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:49,639
'Would you believe that some
gentleman of the foreign press'

567
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:53,142
'are reporting only
what you see on the surface.'

568
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:56,046
The deep inner rot
infecting Germany today

569
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,048
can only be destroyed by the use

570
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,716
of the most stringent
discipline.

571
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:02,019
Discipline? What I have
personally witnessed could

572
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,587
only be described as
the most shocking brutality.

573
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:06,389
'Let me make it clear.'

574
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,793
'For us, there can be but one
decision! We shall fight.'

575
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:15,331
Until the last vestiges of this
bourgeois republic are erased.

576
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:16,799
And a new Germany

577
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:19,302
reborn in the spirit
of national socialism

578
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,206
is once more master
of its own destiny.

579
00:47:27,643 --> 00:47:30,046
<i>Mein Fuhrer.</i>

580
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,115
That was inspiring.

581
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,852
All of Germany
should have heard you.

582
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,096
Is there anything wrong?

583
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:50,167
Do you usually wear
your hair that way?

584
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:54,438
No I...put it up
especially for this evening.

585
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,274
I prefer your hair the way
you wore it this afternoon.

586
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,743
Oh, I'm sorry if I had
only known that--

587
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,577
You can use Frau Goebbels'
dressing room.

588
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:04,347
It's through that door.

589
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:08,384
Do you want me
to change it...now?

590
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:11,288
I have already stated
my preference.

591
00:48:24,634 --> 00:48:27,437
You'd think he had nothing
in his mind but that girl.

592
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,273
I hope the press has
the same impression.

593
00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:32,709
Won't Frau and Harry Guderian
be here this evening?

594
00:48:32,775 --> 00:48:35,045
No...business.

595
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,880
Little party matter
which requires

596
00:48:36,946 --> 00:48:38,548
Herr Guderian's attention.

597
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,043
What possible attraction
could she have for him?

598
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,246
Doesn't she remind you
of someone?

599
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,084
- Geli.
- Of course.

600
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:28,431
Well, now that is better.

601
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,434
Much better.

602
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,707
You should always wear
your hair this way.

603
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:43,513
Yes?

604
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,849
The Reichstag.

605
00:49:45,915 --> 00:49:49,219
<i>Yes-yes, I'll inform the Fuhrer.</i>

606
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:53,323
<i>Mein Fuhrer, the Reichstag
has been set on fire.</i>

607
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,658
Arson.

608
00:49:57,727 --> 00:49:59,663
Open those drapes.

609
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,844
This is monstrous!

610
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,981
This is the work of
an incendiary conspiracy.

611
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,684
Liberals, social democrats.

612
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,820
The Catholic Center Party, Jews.

613
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:26,489
Jews, Jews!

614
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:29,258
The iron fist of
national socialism

615
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:31,227
shall descend on all of them.

616
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:34,797
The flames rising from
the Reichstag shall become

617
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:36,800
a torch of retribution.

618
00:50:38,768 --> 00:50:43,373
I can promise you that this fire
which our enemies have ignited

619
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:46,743
'shall be extinguished
with their blood!'

620
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,679
Terror will be broken by terror.

621
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,159
No!

622
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:03,619
Confine the Dachau.

623
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:06,723
Radissons 857.

624
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,694
Social Democrats, 912.
Catholic Center Party, 3569.

625
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:16,266
Jews, 4296.

626
00:52:17,399 --> 00:52:21,304
From all over Germany.

627
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:25,174
Adolf, I put the storm troopers
together for you.

628
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:27,810
But I'll be damned if
I let you sell them out.

629
00:52:27,877 --> 00:52:31,914
I-If you believe that
you must be insane.

630
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:34,917
Where did you get that idea
from? Your friend Heinz?

631
00:52:34,984 --> 00:52:37,353
From a confidential report
of that meeting you held

632
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,988
with the general staff.

633
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,023
Read it.

634
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,825
Report of General Von Brauwich.

635
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:45,394
"The General Staff considers
Anstreben and the S.A. hostile

636
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:47,763
"in every respect
to it's intimus.

637
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,266
"Their restraint would be
a primary consideration

638
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,169
in any agreement to support you
as Hindenburg's successor."

639
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,404
And this is your answer.

640
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:58,074
"Gentlemen, if we are of
one accord, I can give you

641
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,777
"my personal assurance that
you may regard the demands

642
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:07,217
by Captain Rohm and the S.A.
as utterly inconsequential."

643
00:53:07,283 --> 00:53:08,685
Have you forgotten your promise

644
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:10,987
that the S.A. would
take over army leadership?

645
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:15,958
Our very existence is threatened
and all you're concerned about

646
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:18,161
is the army leadership.

647
00:53:18,227 --> 00:53:20,697
Threatened? By what?

648
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,732
My S.A. has swept
the streets clean.

649
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:25,368
Since the Reichstag fire
all political opposition

650
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:26,936
has been completely eliminated.

651
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,371
Those who haven't fled
the country are either dead

652
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:31,040
or in concentration camps.

653
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:35,211
Because a few thousand swine
are either dead or in prison.

654
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,481
You think we can do what
we want when we can't.

655
00:53:38,547 --> 00:53:41,684
'Hindenburg still occupies
the presidential palace.'

656
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:45,087
Hindenburg, that old man
is practically dead.

657
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:46,856
Exactly.

658
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,626
But apparently, you fail
to realize that his death

659
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,894
means the end
of national socialism.

660
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,296
The end of everything.

661
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,368
Here's a copy of the last
will of testament

662
00:53:58,434 --> 00:54:00,903
of our beloved president.

663
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,006
'It will be published
upon his death.'

664
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:08,411
It asks the general staff to
restore the monarchy to power.

665
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:11,047
Those pigs could never fulfill
that request.

666
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:14,984
The S.A. put the Nazi party in
power and will keep it there.

667
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,352
No.

668
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,821
Civil war with the army
is not the answer.

669
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,723
Negotiations with
the general staff

670
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,993
are our only means
to a bloodless solution.

671
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,696
The only solution acceptable
to the general staff would be

672
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,666
the liquidation of the S.A.

673
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:33,102
Ernst, have you forgotten
what I said to you

674
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:35,104
at the Nuremberg rally?

675
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:38,908
You and the S.A.
are my right arm.

676
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:42,612
Then use it or the general staff
will chop it off.

677
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:47,384
Ernst, you are my best friend.
Trust me.

678
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:52,021
Whatever arrangements I may
have to make will only be

679
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:55,158
because they are expedient.

680
00:54:55,224 --> 00:54:59,428
Even if I should be wrong, I
know I can always rely upon you

681
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:02,699
and the S.A. to rectify
my mistake.

682
00:55:02,765 --> 00:55:05,134
Believe me, if there's
any mistake, the general staff

683
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,869
would have made it.

684
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,138
'I knew I could depend
upon my Ernst.'

685
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,608
Yeah, this is going
to be difficult to explain.

686
00:55:11,674 --> 00:55:14,443
Next month, every ranking
S.A. officer will be meeting

687
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:15,744
at the annual conclave.

688
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:17,547
They're expecting
my announcement

689
00:55:17,613 --> 00:55:19,983
that they've been given command
of the regular army.

690
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,086
It is only a matter of time.

691
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:27,724
Suppose I should attend
the conclave

692
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:31,061
and address them personally.

693
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,329
- Would you?
- Of course.

694
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:37,434
Adolf, that will be
a night to remember.

695
00:55:53,716 --> 00:55:57,620
- Putzi, am I glad to see you?
- Glad to see you too.

696
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,322
- Let's go upstairs.
- Good.

697
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,957
Edmond, Edmond Heines.

698
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,927
There's a package here
for Captain Rohm.

699
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,795
- I'll give it him.
- Thank you.

700
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:08,598
<i>- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler</i>

701
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:19,108
Come in.

702
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,576
Oh, Edmond.

703
00:56:20,642 --> 00:56:22,879
This package came for you.

704
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:23,913
Good.

705
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:28,284
Hmm, whatever you're using
is really nice.

706
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,152
Oh, thank you.

707
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:33,055
Comes from Paris.

708
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:35,257
I'll get some for you.

709
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:36,592
How goes it downstairs?

710
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,461
It's a biggest turnout
we ever had.

711
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:41,263
<i>Good. The Fuhrer
will be pleased.</i>

712
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:45,402
- You really think he'll come?
- You read his telegram.

713
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:48,037
Oh, and I've really got
a big surprise for him.

714
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,906
Open it.

715
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,419
'Well, what do you think of it"

716
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:09,092
<i>"Mein Fuhrer to our
everlasting friendship, Ernst."</i>

717
00:57:10,793 --> 00:57:13,563
I didn't know you're so
sentimental about friendship.

718
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,299
Oh, Edmond.
Don't be stupid.

719
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:19,268
This visit calls for some
token of appreciation.

720
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,137
I still don't understand
your reason

721
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,438
for this sudden admiration.

722
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:25,608
If anyone deserves
a plaque, it should be you.

723
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,143
Guderian is a full general.

724
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:30,313
That little club foot
Goebbels is a cabinet minister.

725
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,616
Himmler is in charge
of the S.S. and the Gestapo.

726
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,618
What has he ever given you?

727
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,520
Friendship.

728
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:42,592
'Now you should be in charge
of Germany's military forces.'

729
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:46,195
Edmond, it's just
a matter of time.

730
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,764
You heard him.

731
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:51,834
He promised me.

732
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:55,805
<i>The Fuhrer gets nervous when
he's reminded of his promises.</i>

733
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:59,008
I think it's only because
he's a little frightened.

734
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:02,812
I put him at the head of
three million storm troopers

735
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:04,380
and suddenly he isn't quite sure

736
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:08,484
whether they're marching
behind him or coming after him.

737
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:16,091
Come now, let us go down.

738
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:19,628
<i>I want to talk to the chef
about the Fuhrer's dinner.</i>

739
00:58:19,695 --> 00:58:21,397
<i>Heil Hitler, the vegetarian.</i>

740
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:23,900
Oh, Edmond, really come.

741
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,272
Shoot that dog.

742
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:33,876
Adolf, what is the meaning?
What are you doing?

743
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,411
Stop him.
Adolf.

744
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,580
- Stop them.
- Traitor.

745
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,615
Now you'll see how
I'll deal with those

746
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,816
who conspire against me.

747
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:42,651
And Heines shall be the first.

748
00:58:42,718 --> 00:58:44,219
Stop them before it's too late.

749
00:58:44,286 --> 00:58:46,422
There's no conspiracy,
there never has been.

750
00:58:46,488 --> 00:58:48,591
- Liar.
- Wha..

751
00:58:48,657 --> 00:58:50,793
You and your circle
of corruption were planning

752
00:58:50,859 --> 00:58:53,496
to assassinate me
and seize the state.

753
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:55,131
That's not true and you know it.

754
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,800
- Now, countermand that order.
- No.

755
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,202
Before this day is over

756
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:03,473
I shall have cleaned
out this filthy pig sty.

757
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,975
Not only here,
but throughout Germany.

758
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,711
I have no place
for scum like you

759
00:59:08,777 --> 00:59:12,915
and Heines
in my new world order.

760
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:17,587
You sick, ominous hypocrite.

761
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,756
When did you acquire
this sudden morality?

762
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:24,694
'After your negotiations
with the generals staff?'

763
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,562
'Ernst!'

764
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:28,197
'Ernst!'

765
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:29,332
Ernst!

766
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:42,612
Is that the price you agreed
to pay the general staff?

767
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:46,282
'You bought their support
with our lives.'

768
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:55,324
But there's another reason
why I must die, isn't it, Adolf?

769
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:58,094
One that goes back to
your barracks in 1919.

770
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:03,132
Do you remember that filthy
pig sty, Adolf, best friend?

771
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,135
You can't permit me to live
because I'm the proof

772
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,170
of your own corruption.

773
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,739
Get him out of here!

774
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:12,675
- You..
- Get rid of him!

775
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:14,944
'Get rid of him!
Get rid of him!'

776
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,338
'Company..'

777
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:45,641
'Halt.'

778
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:47,276
<i>'In the name of the Fuhrer.'</i>

779
01:00:48,377 --> 01:00:49,945
<i>'Heil Hitler.'</i>

780
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:50,780
'Fire.'

781
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:16,739
Open up.

782
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,747
Troupe leader, William Smith.

783
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,417
<i>Stand up, ferul.</i>

784
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,491
Troupe leader, William Smith.

785
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:39,194
No, I don't wanna die.
No.

786
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:40,329
No.

787
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,431
- No.
- Let me go along with him.

788
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:43,532
No.

789
01:01:43,598 --> 01:01:45,735
- No.
- Take him away.

790
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,203
'No.'

791
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,472
I don't wanna die.
No. No.

792
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:51,840
No.

793
01:01:51,907 --> 01:01:54,210
Don't. No, I don't wanna die.
No.

794
01:01:59,314 --> 01:02:02,718
<i>The Fuhrer has granted you
this courtesy.</i>

795
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,053
Use it.

796
01:02:07,556 --> 01:02:10,759
If Hitler wants to see me dead

797
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:13,296
he will have to
shoot me himself.

798
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,703
<i>'In the name of the Fuhrer.'</i>

799
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,604
<i>'Heil Hitler.'</i>

800
01:02:22,671 --> 01:02:25,641
'Fire.'

801
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,244
<i>In the name of the Fuhrer.</i>

802
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:29,378
Hands up.

803
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:32,114
Fire.

804
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,949
<i>'In the name of Fuhrer.'</i>

805
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,518
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

806
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,718
Fire.

807
01:02:36,785 --> 01:02:38,220
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

808
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,888
Fire.

809
01:02:39,955 --> 01:02:41,290
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

810
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,325
Fire.

811
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:44,393
Fire.

812
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,253
<i>Save it for the Fuhrer.</i>

813
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,489
Tell him, I returned
the courtesy.

814
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:20,963
<i>In the name of the Fuhrer.</i>

815
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,899
<i>Heil Hitler.
Fire.</i>

816
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:29,272
Mutinies must be suppressed with
the iron law of decimation.

817
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:33,041
The group, headed by
Chief of staff, Ernst Rohm

818
01:03:33,108 --> 01:03:37,713
And Strasser, were the criminals
of this conspiracy against

819
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:39,815
the security of our Government.

820
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:49,358
I myself ask
to be taken into custody.

821
01:03:53,795 --> 01:03:56,765
I gave the order to shoot
those who were the ringleaders

822
01:03:56,832 --> 01:03:58,401
of this conspiracy.

823
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:05,241
I further gave the order
to burn down the raw flesh

824
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:09,111
the ulcers poisoning the
well springs of Germany.

825
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:21,456
If anyone reproaches me
and asked me why

826
01:04:21,523 --> 01:04:25,427
I did not resort to the regular
courts of justice for conviction

827
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:29,465
of these offenders, then all
I've to say to them is this..

828
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,001
...in that hour..

829
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:35,037
...I was responsible
for the fate of Germany

830
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:38,140
and thereby I became
the supreme judge

831
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:40,209
of the German people.

832
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:04,634
Eva.

833
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:08,971
Mm-hmm?

834
01:05:09,037 --> 01:05:11,207
Where are you going?

835
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,981
<i>It's a personal invitation
from the Fuhrer.</i>

836
01:05:20,048 --> 01:05:22,017
To the Berghof.
Oh, Gretl.

837
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,254
I'm going to be with him
for a whole week.

838
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,060
But what about your job?

839
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:34,296
Do you think anyone would
dare to dismiss me

840
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,932
<i>while I'm the Fuhrer's guest?</i>

841
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,401
Who cares anyway?

842
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,871
Gretl.

843
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:48,777
Be a good sister and let me
borrow your negligee?

844
01:06:03,325 --> 01:06:05,360
Aren't you being
a bit too hopeful?

845
01:06:05,427 --> 01:06:07,663
You've been in love
with him for eight months

846
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,466
and he hasn't shown
the slightest interest in you.

847
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,268
That way.

848
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,371
Oh, he hasn't been
that indifferent.

849
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:17,405
But you can't expect
the most important man

850
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:20,342
in Germany to fall
in love, just like that.

851
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:22,377
What has love
have to do with it?

852
01:06:22,444 --> 01:06:24,847
You're not the first woman
who's had an invitation

853
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,248
to the Berghof.

854
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,153
But I'm goin' to be the last.

855
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,032
You let me know the minute
he's pronounced dead.

856
01:06:48,303 --> 01:06:49,371
What is it, Bormann?

857
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:51,774
<i>Fraulein Braun has arrived.</i>

858
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,113
This line will be
kept open for you.

859
01:07:00,315 --> 01:07:03,485
Hindenburg won't last this day.

860
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:07,155
- And the will?
- Von Papen's orders.

861
01:07:07,222 --> 01:07:09,325
It will be never be published.

862
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,402
Nothing can stop me now.

863
01:07:20,468 --> 01:07:23,839
By this time tomorrow,
I shall be master of Germany.

864
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:28,077
And then mankind will know,
with whom it has to deal.

865
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,128
<i>My Fuhrer.</i>

866
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:49,264
May I please have my robe?

867
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:51,500
'It's lying on the foot
of the bed.'

868
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:10,419
'This concludes
our broadcasting for today.'

869
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:12,387
'There has been
no further bulletin'

870
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:15,691
"from physicians attending the
Great President Von Hindenburg"

871
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,026
'Reich Chancellor Hitler
is still conferring'

872
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:21,029
'with his cabinet
at the Berghof.'

873
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:23,665
That's not true.

874
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:27,503
Reich Chancellor Hitler
is conferring with Eva Braun.

875
01:08:30,105 --> 01:08:32,874
Eva Bruan.

876
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:37,346
'But Reich's Chancellor Hitler
should be with his cabinets.'

877
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:41,851
I'm sure they can wait.

878
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:47,323
At least, until I comb my hair.

879
01:08:54,996 --> 01:08:59,235
Perhaps...even a little longer.

880
01:09:02,437 --> 01:09:05,507
I'm so happy you invited me.

881
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:07,643
The week will seem like a day.

882
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:12,481
Well, then we-we shall have to

883
01:09:12,547 --> 01:09:14,783
extend the invitation.

884
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:24,160
Aren't you going
to arrange your hair?

885
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:27,830
I'll have to wait..

886
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,201
...until it's dry.

887
01:09:52,754 --> 01:09:53,756
<i>My Fuhrer.</i>

888
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:56,925
Is there anything wrong?

889
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:59,761
What do you mean?

890
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:04,400
- Was my kiss so distasteful?
- I don't want to discuss it.

891
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,711
There's something about me
that is frightening you.

892
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:21,416
I've nothing to fear.
You understand? Nothing!

893
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,485
You are Eva Braun.

894
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,622
A photographer's clerk.
A street-walker.

895
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:30,626
A filthy tramp with whom
I can do anything I wish.

896
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:34,095
<i>- My Fuhrer!
- You are Eva Braun.</i>

897
01:10:34,162 --> 01:10:35,497
Say it.

898
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,400
- I am Eva Braun.
- Again.

899
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:41,136
I am Eva Braun.
I am Eva Braun.

900
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:43,739
Look at me!

901
01:10:43,805 --> 01:10:45,774
I am Eva Braun.

902
01:10:53,281 --> 01:10:55,350
No.

903
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,821
You could never
be anything...but her.

904
01:11:15,403 --> 01:11:17,038
<i>My Fuhrer.</i>

905
01:11:17,105 --> 01:11:18,540
Berlin just called.

906
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:24,847
President Hindenburg died
five minutes ago.

907
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,848
- Has Himmler left for Berlin?
- Not yet.

908
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,484
He and the others are waiting
for any last instructions

909
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,887
you may have.

910
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,655
Martin, order my car.

911
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:36,291
<i>You will see that Fraulein Braun
is driven home immediately.</i>

912
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:37,660
<i>Yes, my Fuhrer.</i>

913
01:11:47,402 --> 01:11:48,970
<i>'Fraulein Braun.'</i>

914
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:52,007
'The car will be waiting for you
in half an hour.'

915
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:55,844
'Please be ready.'

916
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:06,982
What did you hope to accomplish
with these cheap melodramatics?

917
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:13,755
Did you think that will change
anything between us?

918
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:18,494
When you have...wanted something
more than life itself

919
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:23,831
and you discover
you can never possess it

920
01:13:23,898 --> 01:13:26,868
'what else was there
for me to do?'

921
01:13:26,934 --> 01:13:30,072
But you must have been aware
that my interest in you

922
01:13:30,138 --> 01:13:31,974
was not based on love.

923
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:35,677
Perhaps not love.

924
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,346
I would have settled for less.

925
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:42,784
But what did you hope to gain
from any relationship with me?

926
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:48,089
Prestige? Influence? Money?

927
01:13:48,156 --> 01:13:51,927
<i>I looked for no reward
other than to serve my Fuhrer.</i>

928
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,832
It is impossible
for me to accept that.

929
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,070
Because of her?

930
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:08,076
The woman you see
when you look at me?

931
01:14:08,142 --> 01:14:11,079
Where does she end?

932
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:12,614
Where do I begin?

933
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,928
You mustn't.

934
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,866
Why can't you leave me in peace?

935
01:14:31,566 --> 01:14:32,835
'Please.'

936
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,939
I can't stand it any longer.

937
01:14:37,572 --> 01:14:38,807
'Adolf.'

938
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:43,945
Why must you torture me
like this?

939
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,814
I am your son.

940
01:14:49,016 --> 01:14:52,120
I'll never be anything but her.

941
01:14:59,694 --> 01:15:01,896
It doesn't matter.

942
01:15:01,963 --> 01:15:05,868
Believe me.
It just doesn't matter.

943
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:07,102
I understand.

944
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:10,172
Do you?

945
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,309
Can you understand
this compulsion

946
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:17,479
which fills me with disgust?

947
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:20,848
That turns me away
from every woman.

948
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:25,353
I am not like other men.

949
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,323
Desire turns to revulsion.

950
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:32,727
Gratification,
which even an animal enjoys

951
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:35,329
is denied me.

952
01:15:35,396 --> 01:15:37,632
Can you understand that?

953
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:41,737
Yes...and even more than that.

954
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:44,573
But it doesn't have
to be that way any longer.

955
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:49,711
It is useless.

956
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:52,347
There can be no happiness for me

957
01:15:52,413 --> 01:15:55,450
as long as she exists.

958
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:58,152
But she is dead.

959
01:15:58,219 --> 01:16:00,589
No matter how real
she may seem to you

960
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:04,192
'she has only existed
in your mind.'

961
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:21,843
'Adolf, look at me.'

962
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:37,292
'The proof that she
is no longer there'

963
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,194
'is in your eyes.'

964
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:51,973
<i>The death
of President Von Hindenburg</i>

965
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,142
<i>on August 2nd, 1934</i>

966
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:58,179
<i>removed the last obstacle
to complete power for Hitler.</i>

967
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:01,850
<i>Virtually unchallenged,
Hitler consolidated the offices</i>

968
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:03,719
<i>of president and chancellor</i>

969
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:07,088
<i>establishing
an absolute dictatorship.</i>

970
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:10,224
<i>It was the beginning
of Hitler's New World Order.</i>

971
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:14,996
<i>A barbaric concept designed
for enslaving humanity.</i>

972
01:17:15,062 --> 01:17:17,231
<i>In a continual display of power</i>

973
01:17:17,298 --> 01:17:20,101
<i>designed to intimidate
and impress the world</i>

974
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:23,038
<i>Hitler's massive legions
marched triumphantly</i>

975
01:17:23,104 --> 01:17:26,141
<i>under the banner
of the twisted cross.</i>

976
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,942
<i>Adhering faithfully
to his precept</i>

977
01:17:28,009 --> 01:17:29,577
<i>of total obedience.</i>

978
01:17:29,644 --> 01:17:33,348
<i>They swore unconditionally
to lay down their lives</i>

979
01:17:33,414 --> 01:17:35,016
<i>for their Fuhrer.</i>

980
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:37,952
<i>To implement Hitler's dream
of world conquest</i>

981
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:39,821
<i>factories
were secretly converted</i>

982
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:43,391
<i>from civilian
to military production.</i>

983
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:46,995
<i>Rearmament became Germany's
most important industry.</i>

984
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:53,435
<i>On March 7th, 1936, convinced
of his infallible destiny</i>

985
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:55,003
<i>to rule the world</i>

986
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,139
<i>Hitler set in motion
the destructive forces</i>

987
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,708
<i>which were, ultimately,
to cost the lives</i>

988
01:18:00,775 --> 01:18:03,178
<i>of 50 million people.</i>

989
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:06,181
Gentlemen,
at this historic moment

990
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:08,282
three battalions
of German troops

991
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:10,452
are marching..

992
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:12,154
...in the Marine land.

993
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:18,493
By this action
I have not only broken

994
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,395
the shackles
of the Versailles Treaty

995
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:24,666
but I have also opened the door
to our future victories.

996
01:18:24,732 --> 01:18:30,504
The conquest and subjugation
of Europe will be our next task.

997
01:18:30,571 --> 01:18:33,408
After that...the world!

998
01:18:35,476 --> 01:18:38,012
'Nexus in Austria
wipes out forever

999
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,714
'the artificial barriers'

1000
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:42,283
'between the
German-speaking nations.'

1001
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,620
'As of this day,
we are one people'

1002
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:48,757
'one culture, under one law.'

1003
01:18:50,558 --> 01:18:53,428
Now that the question
of the Sudetenland

1004
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:55,997
has been peacefully resolved

1005
01:18:56,063 --> 01:19:00,268
I welcome Czechoslovakia
into the German sphere.

1006
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:10,711
'Germany's desire for peace
has been constantly threatened'

1007
01:19:10,778 --> 01:19:13,181
'by Poland's armed might.'

1008
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:16,951
'This intolerable danger
to the German nation'

1009
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:20,155
'must be ruthlessly crushed.'

1010
01:19:23,324 --> 01:19:27,028
There will be
a final reckoning with France

1011
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:30,698
the inexorable mortal enemy
of the German people.

1012
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:34,302
She will never be permitted
to rise again as a nation.

1013
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,510
'Violence shall serve
as an example'

1014
01:19:42,576 --> 01:19:47,482
'to the smaller nations,
that resistance is futile.'

1015
01:19:47,548 --> 01:19:51,052
'As for our violation
of neutrality and subjugation'

1016
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,054
'of non-combatant countries'

1017
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,423
'who will there be left
to protest'

1018
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,225
'after we have
conquered Europe?'

1019
01:20:07,368 --> 01:20:11,806
Slavic peoples
are to be regarded as sub-human

1020
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:15,544
fit only for enslavement
or extermination.

1021
01:20:20,648 --> 01:20:24,052
Except for ineffectual
pockets of resistance

1022
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:28,990
in Moscow and Stalingrad,
Europe is ours.

1023
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,700
<i>And even as Hitler
gloated in triumph</i>

1024
01:20:38,766 --> 01:20:40,368
<i>these pockets of resistance</i>

1025
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:43,238
<i>exploded in violent
counter attacks</i>

1026
01:20:43,304 --> 01:20:45,139
<i>Coordinated
with massive allied action</i>

1027
01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:46,640
<i>throughout the world</i>

1028
01:20:46,707 --> 01:20:49,945
<i>on a scale unprecedented
in modern warfare.</i>

1029
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:53,248
<i>The Nazi juggernaut
began to crumble.</i>

1030
01:20:54,915 --> 01:20:56,151
Surrender?

1031
01:20:57,585 --> 01:21:01,789
"Unable to resist
Russian offensive any longer."

1032
01:21:01,856 --> 01:21:03,524
"Von Paulus."

1033
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:06,928
I will not be denied
total victory.

1034
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:08,996
Von Paulus
should have died fighting.

1035
01:21:09,063 --> 01:21:11,565
Set an example to his troops.

1036
01:21:13,067 --> 01:21:15,036
And I made him a Field Marshal.

1037
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:16,604
<i>My Fuhrer.</i>

1038
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:19,540
As we advised you
prior to that operation

1039
01:21:19,607 --> 01:21:22,243
Von Paulus might have
defeated the Russians.

1040
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,247
But no one has ever won a
victory over the Russian snow.

1041
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:29,818
Marshal Rommel,
snow may have been reason

1042
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:32,753
for Von Paulus defeat.
What was yours?

1043
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:36,458
If my memory serves me right,
snow is as rare as your victory

1044
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:40,061
- in North Africa.
- The loss of North Africa--

1045
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:44,866
Reasons. Excuses. Explanations.
They apply only to defeat.

1046
01:21:44,932 --> 01:21:49,404
No one has to explain victory.
It speaks for itself.

1047
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:52,039
Let me make myself clear,
gentlemen.

1048
01:21:52,106 --> 01:21:54,676
These reverses must stop.

1049
01:21:54,742 --> 01:21:56,277
<i>My Fuhrer.</i>

1050
01:21:56,344 --> 01:22:00,181
It is our considered opinion
that an armistice now

1051
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:03,351
may permit us to retain
what we already hold.

1052
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:05,953
And prevent
the ultimate obliteration

1053
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,089
of Germany.

1054
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:11,159
Am I to understand
that you are already preparing

1055
01:22:11,225 --> 01:22:13,161
an excuse for defeat?

1056
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:22,203
As of this day, further excuses
will not be accepted.

1057
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,105
Any officer
who finds it necessary

1058
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:27,175
to offer one
will answer to me, personally..

1059
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:30,244
...with his life.

1060
01:22:30,311 --> 01:22:32,113
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

1061
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:44,225
<i>Members of the general staff
will meet Fuhrer in my office.</i>

1062
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,594
All others are to return
to their posts.

1063
01:22:56,637 --> 01:22:57,605
Gentlemen.

1064
01:22:59,406 --> 01:23:01,742
In the interest of the state..

1065
01:23:01,809 --> 01:23:06,114
...it is my opinion that the
time has come for us to act.

1066
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:12,219
<i>I shall deliver my report
to the Fuhrer</i>

1067
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:13,755
at the first opportunity.

1068
01:23:14,755 --> 01:23:17,291
Colonel Stauffenberg.

1069
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:20,294
There can be no margin
for error.

1070
01:23:20,361 --> 01:23:23,898
Our lives
and the fate of Germany

1071
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,600
will depend on it.

1072
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:45,153
<i>We are ready for you now,
my Fuhrer.</i>

1073
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,658
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

1074
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:54,162
I will be ready for your report
in a few minutes.

1075
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:57,999
We believe
the most effective method

1076
01:23:58,065 --> 01:23:59,968
of implementing your plan

1077
01:24:00,034 --> 01:24:02,203
without weakening
our western defenses

1078
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:08,042
would be to use the Hungarian
and Romanian troops.

1079
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:11,245
'I'm afraid they don't have
much stomach for fighting..'

1080
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:14,282
'...and their loyalty
is questionable at best.'

1081
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:22,056
A breakthrough would mean
the loss of Poland.

1082
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:24,025
Whose briefcase is this?

1083
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:26,160
<i>Uh, it belongs to me, my Fuhrer.</i>

1084
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:28,996
Well, get it out of my way.

1085
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:32,367
You had better check
Oberst Stauffenberg's report.

1086
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:36,037
This is going to require
all of my attention.

1087
01:24:36,103 --> 01:24:38,806
Let me have your report, Oberst.

1088
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:40,108
Here.

1089
01:24:46,466 --> 01:24:48,816
I'm sorry, General.
This is the wrong briefcase.

1090
01:24:48,882 --> 01:24:51,853
I have the report
in my other bag in the car.

1091
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,487
I shall be back in a minute.

1092
01:24:53,554 --> 01:24:57,325
- Where's Brandt?
- Oberst Brandt.

1093
01:25:00,961 --> 01:25:04,265
What is the disposition
of our troops in this area?

1094
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,229
<i>My Fuhrer!</i>

1095
01:25:36,797 --> 01:25:38,666
Call Himmler!

1096
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:55,950
Not until the last one
of these dogs is destroyed!

1097
01:25:56,016 --> 01:25:57,252
Drop 'em!

1098
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:17,172
<i>- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!</i>

1099
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,010
- General Guderian?
- Yes.

1100
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:24,812
<i>The Fuhrer's expecting us.</i>

1101
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:27,882
'You will remove your side arms,
and open your bags.'

1102
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:30,218
These bags contain
secret maps and documents.

1103
01:26:30,284 --> 01:26:32,853
We're not interested in
your maps and documents.

1104
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,254
Open those bags!

1105
01:26:34,321 --> 01:26:36,657
I will not submit
to this indignity.

1106
01:26:36,723 --> 01:26:39,494
<i>Those are the Fuhrer's orders!
For everyone!</i>

1107
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:59,214
<i>- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!</i>

1108
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:03,184
Good morning, General Guderian.

1109
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:07,020
<i>- Fraulein Braun.
- Gentlemen.</i>

1110
01:27:07,087 --> 01:27:09,324
<i>Gentlemen, the Fuhrer.</i>

1111
01:27:12,226 --> 01:27:13,628
<i>'Heil Hitler!'</i>

1112
01:27:19,466 --> 01:27:22,303
You may as well stay here.

1113
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:26,974
My distinguished staff, you're
refrained from using the word

1114
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:29,410
"retreat", in front of a woman.

1115
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:31,646
<i>- My Fuhrer--
- But, isn't it true?</i>

1116
01:27:31,712 --> 01:27:34,482
Every time, I talk to one
of you, I only hear

1117
01:27:34,548 --> 01:27:36,984
of some new disaster.

1118
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:41,154
I warn you...I will not tolerate
any further requests

1119
01:27:41,221 --> 01:27:43,024
for withdrawal of troops.

1120
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:47,561
<i>My Fuhrer, I'm afraid
it's too late for withdrawal.</i>

1121
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:52,266
East Prussia has been
cut-off from the right.

1122
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:55,003
The enemy crossed
the Oder river last night.

1123
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:59,073
What is the present position?

1124
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,675
100 miles from Berlin.

1125
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:06,781
You! Y-you you are responsible!

1126
01:28:06,847 --> 01:28:08,515
You should have prevented
that crossing

1127
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:10,117
no matter what the cost!

1128
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:13,787
I pulled back at the last moment
to avoid complete annihilation.

1129
01:28:13,854 --> 01:28:17,724
I-I-I'm not interested
in saving lives.

1130
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:21,128
Your orders were to defend
the position to the last man!

1131
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:23,864
<i>My Fuhrer, I'm willing
to die for Germany.</i>

1132
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:26,900
But I refuse to die
without purpose.

1133
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:29,970
You swore an oath
to me, to risk your life

1134
01:28:30,037 --> 01:28:31,272
at my command!

1135
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:34,007
It is my decision,
mine alone, whether

1136
01:28:34,074 --> 01:28:35,576
your life has any purpose!

1137
01:28:37,044 --> 01:28:39,947
General Keitl, you will issue
a directive in my name

1138
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:42,049
to all the armed forces.

1139
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:44,718
Any soldier, or officer

1140
01:28:44,785 --> 01:28:49,289
who fails to defend his position
or retreats one step

1141
01:28:49,356 --> 01:28:51,059
'is to be summarily shot!'

1142
01:28:53,794 --> 01:28:57,631
Martin, get my things ready.
I'm leaving for Berlin.

1143
01:28:57,698 --> 01:29:01,836
<i>Headquarters will be established
at the Fuhrerbunker.</i>

1144
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:03,604
You'll report to me there.

1145
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:06,941
<i>My Fuhrer, we have neither
the arms, nor the men</i>

1146
01:29:07,007 --> 01:29:13,047
to continue this war.
I suggest we seek an armistice.

1147
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,948
Swine!

1148
01:29:15,015 --> 01:29:18,619
Do you wish to add high treason
to an act of cowardice?

1149
01:29:19,486 --> 01:29:21,555
I shall never capitulate!

1150
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:23,691
Nothing will change
my decision to fight

1151
01:29:23,757 --> 01:29:27,495
until I have achieved victory!

1152
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:29,731
Now, get out, all of you!

1153
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,448
Adolf..

1154
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:50,718
...let me
go with you.

1155
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:53,187
No, it'd be too dangerous.

1156
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:55,857
But you'd need
someone to take care of you.

1157
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:57,691
Bormann will be with me.

1158
01:29:57,758 --> 01:29:58,860
Please.

1159
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:02,530
I'll meet you at the car.

1160
01:30:03,964 --> 01:30:05,199
Eva.

1161
01:30:05,265 --> 01:30:08,168
This is the greatest
challenge I've ever faced.

1162
01:30:08,235 --> 01:30:13,574
I must be free to cope with it.
I will have no time for you.

1163
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:19,747
Victory. All that matters is
victory. I'm going with you.

1164
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:22,683
You will remain here
at the Berghof.

1165
01:30:22,749 --> 01:30:26,053
I forbid you to come to Berlin.

1166
01:30:26,119 --> 01:30:28,889
How many times must
I tell you that there can be

1167
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,592
no personal life for us.
Marriage or otherwise

1168
01:30:31,658 --> 01:30:33,428
until this war is won.

1169
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:44,205
Adolf...if we should
lose the war, what then?

1170
01:30:46,273 --> 01:30:48,209
Even you.

1171
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,211
Adolf, General Guderian
indicated there's no hope

1172
01:30:51,278 --> 01:30:53,147
and the others agreed with him.

1173
01:30:53,213 --> 01:30:56,717
General Guderian is
a fool. They're all fools.

1174
01:30:58,185 --> 01:31:02,990
Despite everything, I shall
not be deprived of victory.

1175
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:24,678
<i>'Our beloved Fuhrer
has sworn to remain here'</i>

1176
01:31:24,745 --> 01:31:28,348
'and defend the
reign that has arrived.'

1177
01:31:28,415 --> 01:31:31,686
'In this, our greatest ordeal'

1178
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:36,523
'we must prove that we are
worthy of his leadership.'

1179
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:39,494
<i>'Our Fuhrer expects no less.'</i>

1180
01:31:41,695 --> 01:31:44,131
The enemy must pay with blood.

1181
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:47,168
For every foot of German soil,
he occupies.

1182
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:51,706
General Keitel. Urgent.

1183
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:01,916
Well.

1184
01:32:01,982 --> 01:32:05,586
<i>My Fuhrer, Germany
has been cut in two.</i>

1185
01:32:05,652 --> 01:32:07,521
The Americans have
crossed the Elbe river

1186
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:09,757
at a point only
sixty miles from Berlin.

1187
01:32:13,093 --> 01:32:16,697
The only forces we have intact
are north of this line.

1188
01:32:17,731 --> 01:32:19,767
Well, what are you waiting for?

1189
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:24,905
Order them to counter-attack.
Must I do everything?

1190
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:29,210
<i>My Fuhrer, with the armament
plants in Upper Silesia</i>

1191
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:32,913
and the river
now held by the enemy

1192
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,616
'we are no longer able
to procure supplies.'

1193
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:40,220
The failure to destroy those
plants was an act of treason.

1194
01:32:40,287 --> 01:32:44,458
Nothing's to be left
intact for the allies.

1195
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:46,894
I want the country laid waste.

1196
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,963
We shall leave them nothing
but the scorched earth.

1197
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:54,468
<i>My Fuhrer,
I beg you to reconsider.</i>

1198
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:57,972
Those resources must be
spared for the German people.

1199
01:32:58,038 --> 01:33:00,607
The welfare of the
weaklings who survive

1200
01:33:00,674 --> 01:33:04,678
this war is of no concern to me.

1201
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:08,015
They are not fit
to be called Germans.

1202
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:11,385
If we should lose
this war, I will take

1203
01:33:11,451 --> 01:33:13,854
what is left of Germany with me.

1204
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:45,452
<i>- Where's the Fuhrer?
- He's not in his bedroom.</i>

1205
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:47,321
Let's try the conference room.

1206
01:34:07,974 --> 01:34:11,345
I will be with you
gentlemen in a minute.

1207
01:34:14,114 --> 01:34:18,585
<i>Fuhrer, the enemy has penetrated</i>

1208
01:34:18,652 --> 01:34:20,888
the outskirts of Berlin.

1209
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:24,725
Their guns zeroed
in on the bunker.

1210
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,496
I have just completed
the details of a plan

1211
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:33,233
which will change
the entire course of war.

1212
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,103
'The allies believe
that we have lost the war.'

1213
01:34:36,169 --> 01:34:40,908
That we will remain un-defensive
until we're destroyed.

1214
01:34:40,975 --> 01:34:44,111
But we will not play
their game. Ha-ha-ha.

1215
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:48,381
'We shall take offensive.'

1216
01:34:48,448 --> 01:34:52,919
With the focus of Berlin center,
General Vince's army will attack

1217
01:34:52,986 --> 01:34:56,623
in the South
and General Steiner's army

1218
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:58,693
will flank the
enemy on the North.

1219
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:02,729
Well?

1220
01:35:02,796 --> 01:35:05,633
<i>My Fuhrer, the
armies of General Vince</i>

1221
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:09,102
and General Steiner
no longer exist.

1222
01:35:09,169 --> 01:35:12,606
We should keep
General Heinrich's ninth army

1223
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:14,108
in reserve.

1224
01:35:14,174 --> 01:35:17,578
That should take care
of any unforeseen contingencies.

1225
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:22,816
<i>Mein Fuhrer,
Heinrich's army surrendered</i>

1226
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:25,853
to the American
forces, last week.

1227
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:40,935
No such thing has occurred.

1228
01:35:43,403 --> 01:35:47,174
I'm well aware of your
desires to end this war.

1229
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,743
Make no mistake, gentlemen.

1230
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,413
There should be
no attempts of armistice

1231
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,281
as long as I am in command.

1232
01:35:55,682 --> 01:35:59,819
This counter-offensive will
go forward as scheduled.

1233
01:35:59,886 --> 01:36:02,089
I shall expect
your hourly reports.

1234
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:36,957
Eva..

1235
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:41,862
...I didn't think
you could get through.

1236
01:36:41,928 --> 01:36:45,232
<i>What's wrong with the Fuhrer?</i>

1237
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:48,435
He's been this
way since yesterday.

1238
01:36:48,501 --> 01:36:53,874
We are unable to make him
understand, the war is lost.

1239
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:55,742
He ordered a counter-offensive

1240
01:36:55,809 --> 01:36:57,844
by armies that
simply do not exist.

1241
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:10,824
Berlin?

1242
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:17,263
<i>My Fuhrer, no one seems to know
anything about a counterattack.</i>

1243
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:22,369
Josef, Martin. Where are
the General Keitel

1244
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:24,371
and General Yodl?

1245
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:27,674
They all attempted
to leave yesterday

1246
01:37:27,741 --> 01:37:30,544
supervise a counter-attack.

1247
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:32,512
Why haven't I heard from them?

1248
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:40,453
I shall not tolerate
this gross insubordination.

1249
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:47,228
Adolf...there is no counter
offensive.

1250
01:37:49,129 --> 01:37:51,632
There never will be.

1251
01:37:56,436 --> 01:38:01,475
I have been betrayed
by everyone. Resented by all.

1252
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:05,613
I have been surrounded
by conspirators.

1253
01:38:08,682 --> 01:38:12,586
Murderers. Cowards. Traitors.

1254
01:38:12,652 --> 01:38:17,991
Himmler, Goering, the general
staff, the army.

1255
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:21,294
Even those filthy swine.

1256
01:38:21,361 --> 01:38:23,230
The German people
have failed me.

1257
01:38:24,631 --> 01:38:28,201
I hold them all
responsible for our defeat.

1258
01:38:28,268 --> 01:38:32,839
The enemy did not win this war.

1259
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:35,508
Victory was given to them.

1260
01:38:35,575 --> 01:38:41,381
And I could have made myself,
master of the world.

1261
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:51,558
Adolf.

1262
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:05,072
You should have
remained at the Berghof.

1263
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:07,340
The radio announced
your decision to remain

1264
01:39:07,407 --> 01:39:13,013
here until the end.
My place is with you.

1265
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,449
Do you realize
what that end will be?

1266
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:23,324
I've come to share it
with you. As your wife.

1267
01:39:38,772 --> 01:39:45,145
Do you, Adolf Hitler, swear
that you are of Aryan descent

1268
01:39:45,212 --> 01:39:48,382
'and free of any
hereditary disease?'

1269
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:49,716
I do.

1270
01:39:49,783 --> 01:39:52,919
'Do you, Eva Braun,
swear that you're'

1271
01:39:52,986 --> 01:39:55,555
'of Aryan descent and free
of any hereditary disease?'

1272
01:39:55,622 --> 01:39:56,757
I do.

1273
01:39:56,823 --> 01:39:59,426
Then, in the presence
of these witnesses

1274
01:39:59,492 --> 01:40:01,928
and under the laws
of the Third Reich..

1275
01:40:01,995 --> 01:40:08,302
...as of this day April 29,
1945, you are man and wife.

1276
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:19,279
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

1277
01:40:30,123 --> 01:40:34,261
Adolf...let me be first.

1278
01:40:36,897 --> 01:40:38,799
I don't want to see you die.

1279
01:40:55,882 --> 01:40:57,584
The gun is quicker.

1280
01:41:00,887 --> 01:41:06,326
It won't make any difference.
We are to be cremated.

1281
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:10,163
I won't have them making
a spectacle of our bodies.

1282
01:41:10,229 --> 01:41:13,967
No. No, of course not.

1283
01:41:14,034 --> 01:41:16,336
But it doesn't matter.

1284
01:41:16,402 --> 01:41:23,210
<i>I shall be proud to die as
your wife. As Frau Hitler.</i>

1285
01:41:24,911 --> 01:41:31,118
<i>Frau Hitler. I rewarded your
loyalty by making you my wife.</i>

1286
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:34,154
And then only because
we are to die.

1287
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:36,190
But marriage did not
give you the privilege

1288
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:38,725
<i>of calling yourself Frau Hitler.</i>

1289
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:43,663
Only one woman ever
had the right to that name.

1290
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:50,337
No. No, it belongs to me.
I'm paying for it with my life.

1291
01:41:51,838 --> 01:41:54,240
You're permitted
to die at my side.

1292
01:41:54,307 --> 01:41:57,043
Should be sufficient reward.

1293
01:41:58,645 --> 01:42:04,184
You did not understand me.
The world did not understand me.

1294
01:42:05,752 --> 01:42:09,723
Nor was it prepared to
accept what I had to offer.

1295
01:42:11,091 --> 01:42:15,495
Those who follow me
will not find it difficult.

1296
01:42:15,562 --> 01:42:20,400
For I have laid the groundwork.
I have shown them the way.

1297
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:33,547
<i>Hitler died as he had lived.</i>

1298
01:42:33,614 --> 01:42:37,751
<i>A raging psychotic threatening
the world with destruction.</i>

1299
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:42,956
<i>His epitaph, the enormity of
his crimes against humanity.</i>

1300
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:45,958
<i>Written in the blood
stained pages of history.</i>

1301
01:42:46,025 --> 01:42:48,795
<i>It will remain an
ever-lasting indictment</i>

1302
01:42:48,862 --> 01:42:53,500
<i>of the most infamous barbarian
the world has ever known.</i>
