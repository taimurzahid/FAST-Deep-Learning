1
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:21,804
This way!

2
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:40,982
-There!
-Where?

3
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:43,320
next to the farther beach tree!

4
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:01,478
Get Down, Down.

5
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:44,746
THE RED BARON

6
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:54,091
Northern France, Allied territory 1916,
10 years later

7
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:36,967
German airfield near the front, France,
30 minutes later

8
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,650
Are you out of your bloody mind?

9
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:48,184
Yes Sir

10
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:52,661
You risk the squadron planes to
attend an enemy funeral?

11
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,012
Yes sir!

12
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,531
Lehmann and Sternberg knew him sir,
Captain Winston Clyde Walker.

13
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,012
 the coffin I mean sir

14
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,818
Yes, i mean Sir..

15
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:07,467
My uncle, the Duke of Westchester
is mother's brother-in-law

16
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,253
Lehmann and me went to college with him.
At Eton, Sir.

17
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:14,011
You are talking about a British pilot,
god damn it.

18
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,911
One of the best the RFC had.

19
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:18,239
It's a pity that he's not alive anymore,
Sir.

20
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,179
To hell with you.

21
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:24,200
Dismissed!

22
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,272
I've heard your plane cought some bullets

23
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,403
while you were visiting
the funeral, Richthofen.

24
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,475
Ah, I just love these tiny chatty
Airfields, Kielmeyer.

25
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:42,396
Does anybody want a cigarette?
- You have French ones?

26
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:47,785
-De rien.
-Merci.

27
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,728
Richthofen shot down a two-seater today.

28
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:55,980
I guess it was meant as compensation
for disobeying my orders?

29
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,350
No.

30
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:58,945
I just wanted to score.

31
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:06,252
I have just received a report that a
British RE8

32
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:07,802
went down 12 km from here.

33
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,983
You have my deepest respect, Baron.

34
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:13,633
Let us go and find it to confirm your kill.

35
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,457
Come on lend a hand!

36
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:49,038
One

37
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:50,396
two

38
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:55,114
I said be careful!

39
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:00,929
That doesn't look good.

40
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:11,654
Put him there...

41
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,192
Hurry up, he is heavy.

42
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:18,292
He is losing much blood.

43
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,175
Lend a hand.

44
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:21,435
Hold that.

45
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,154
You will make it.

46
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,022
We must carry him to the car.

47
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:32,162
Immediately.

48
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:33,576
Take him!

49
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,855
Thank you.

50
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:42,776
You have saved his life.

51
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:43,805
No.

52
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,563
I shot him down.

53
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,937
You got him, Sternberg.

54
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:12,608
...rubbish. The DH2 one-seater should be
attacked from above...

55
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:14,985
See Sterni, if the attacker has a rotary
engine then....

56
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,861
What is a rotary engine?

57
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,722
Oh Lieutenant Sternberg...

58
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,026
Hey, come back.

59
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:31,016
Well, Voss.

60
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,078
Obviously she prefers men like me. Right?

61
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:36,310
Men like you?

62
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:41,483
Moses, Freud...
- Perhaps we also should get circumcised?

63
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,152
Hey where are you going?

64
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,990
What do you think Manfred,
she looks like your little nurse huh?

65
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:54,859
...I mean: DAT ASS.

66
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,663
I'm sorry Sir.

67
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:03,530
What are you doing here?

68
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:07,042
Come, drink with us.

69
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,847
I thought the gentlemen just
wanted to drink a cocktail.

70
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:15,492
Sit, drink and relax...

71
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,309
I'm married you know...

72
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:28,900
Me too.

73
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:33,244
I mean, almost.

74
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:38,062
...we need a bit of water.

75
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:50,751
The driver says the engine is overheated.

76
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:17,968
Lieutenant.
-My name is von Richthofen.

77
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:21,029
I'm glad to see you again, Mademoiselle.

78
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,371
I know your name.
-Oh really?

79
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,971
The pilot that you shot down told me your
name.

80
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,560
So he survived?

81
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,198
Are you just asking or
does it really interest you?

82
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:33,948
The former.

83
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,223
At least you are honest.

84
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:38,239
That's a good start isn't it?

85
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,787
Can't I just ask without being interested?

86
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,964
So, what's your name?

87
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,932
His name is Captain Roy Brown.

88
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,216
And he's still alive regardless of other
things.

89
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:54,620
He told me that you were a brilliant pilot

90
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,326
and a cheeky rogue.

91
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:58,760
I understand.

92
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,877
Tell him that I am flattered by his
compliments.

93
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:04,225
And that I hope that we will

94
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:05,623
never meet in the sky again.

95
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:07,938
He might still get me.

96
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:10,998
And perhaps I won't have
the same luck as him.

97
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:13,622
And meet such a gorgeous nurse.

98
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,798
Unbelievable. Have a nice evening.

99
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,930
Have you seen my scarf?

100
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,218
I'll send it to you.

101
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,456
No no, you can keep it.

102
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:27,742
It's a lucky charm.

103
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,525
The French have sent their condolences

104
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:31,396
together with the confirmation of the kill.

105
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,324
The mass for Kielmeyer will be today at 4pm

106
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:39,153
The enemy pilot who lead the attack four
days ago

107
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:41,699
it was Hawker.

108
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:43,813
What?

109
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,254
Major Lanoe Hawker?

110
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:49,022
Yes, exactly.

111
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:52,676
I saw his face. He had a beard.

112
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,374
And the Grim Reaper painted on his plane.

113
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,575
It's their best man.

114
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:00,698
He's a nasty fellow.
He already shot down 9 of our men.

115
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:03,513
When they were still flying unarmed recon
missions

116
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:05,734
he already mounted a gun on his plane.

117
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:07,735
I could barely shake him off.

118
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,064
He came pretty near.

119
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:13,261
Then why didn't you attack him?

120
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,491
I only attack if I can win.

121
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:35,886
How important is the Pour le Merite for you?

122
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:39,261
I would kill for it.

123
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:43,495
I just got a telegram from the Army High
Command

124
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,438
they want to give it to you by all means.

125
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,219
So what are they waiting for?

126
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,074
You know the regulations.

127
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,485
And not even the Kaiser would ignore the
regulations

128
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,964
so you better do what they want
and shoot down a balloon.

129
00:17:57,802 --> 00:17:58,888
I hunt planes.

130
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,777
And not things that cannot move.

131
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,919
You are not a hunter lieutenant.

132
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,547
You are a soldier. And you have to obey
orders.

133
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:09,505
Especially if the orders were issued
by General von Höppler himself.

134
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:26,167
What if I shoot down Hawker?

135
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,260
Avoid Hawker.

136
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,136
You are not a match for him.

137
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:38,699
Let me through.

138
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,306
Anybody have a wrench?

139
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,214
I can't believe it.

140
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:43,463
Now you've finally made it.

141
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,166
You shot down a legend.

142
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,130
Now you are one too.

143
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,719
Go ahead and eat, my mother made them.

144
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:56,515
Mhh, delicious.

145
00:19:57,644 --> 00:19:59,004
Lieutenant Oswald Boelcke.

146
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:00,964
They are desperately searching for somebody

147
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,250
who steps in his footprints.

148
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:04,529
I asked him about his secret.

149
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,906
His answer was:

150
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,235
"It's simple...

151
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,920
...I fly as near as possible to the enemy...

152
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:12,989
...pull the trigger...

153
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,909
...and of course he will come down."

154
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,129
Sterni and me are going to Arras, drink a
bit...

155
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:21,411
Come with us.

156
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,753
Perhaps we meet your nurse again?

157
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:27,086
You have to get her already

158
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:28,756
or she will stay in your head forever.

159
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,357
The earlier you lose your traction the
better...

160
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,085
Werner?

161
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:41,600
I will become a legend myself.

162
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,315
I will be the Ace of Aces.

163
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:50,762
High Army Command, Western Front, Lille,
France January 1917

164
00:21:00,337 --> 00:21:01,431
Stop!

165
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,069
There you go.

166
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:09,691
I'm starving.

167
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,191
Me too.

168
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,207
Prussians never complain, gentlemen.

169
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:31,275
Let's go.

170
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:35,628
Bring back some breakfast.

171
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,881
At ease, gentlemen.

172
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,838
L'ordre Pour Le Merite...

173
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:03,929
Let's see...

174
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:07,956
Prussia's highest medal for bravery.

175
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:12,224
A year ago Boelcke was the first pilot to
be awarded.

176
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:15,528
Things have changed since then.

177
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:18,100
Don't you think, Baron?

178
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,622
Indeed, General.

179
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:24,615
He only had to shoot down 8 planes.

180
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,536
I had to shoot down twice as many.

181
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:29,398
We already made an exception for you,
Richthofen.

182
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,910
You still owe us a balloon, am I right?

183
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:36,516
But because you shot down the best enemy
guy...

184
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:38,229
"the unbeatable Major Hawker"

185
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,506
I appoint you the highest German Ace.

186
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:45,792
You take over command of 11th Squadron.

187
00:22:45,793 --> 00:22:47,820
-Come with me.
-Excellent, General.

188
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:54,770
Look at this: in the east the Tsar's forces
pose no danger to us, Gentlemen.

189
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:57,772
There wil be a revolution in Russia.

190
00:22:57,773 --> 00:22:59,293
Amusing isn't it?

191
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,979
Lenin and his communists help the German
Kaiser...

192
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:09,631
Well, the western front poses the biggest
threat to us.

193
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:14,821
The English 1st and 3rd Armies are advancing
with everything they have.

194
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:17,633
And they have much to offer.

195
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:25,863
I have to get them out of there.

196
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,802
Step by step and day after day.

197
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:31,779
Even without Lenin's help.

198
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:42,186
Richhofen, your base will be at La
Brayelles.

199
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,914
Northwest of Douai.

200
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:53,629
General?

201
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,065
Yes?

202
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,569
Shouldn't we be much nearer to Paris?

203
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:03,460
I mean, you have said two months ago
that we would be there in ten days.

204
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:04,888
Manfred!

205
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:20,314
The high command has given you a big
responsibility, young man.

206
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:22,145
Much greater than this medal.

207
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:25,618
You are not only responsible for the men
under your command.

208
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:27,974
That's not why we have promoted you.

209
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:31,293
You were chosen to be the symbolic commander
of all flying units.

210
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:35,726
You are an idol because of your courage,
honor and perseverance.

211
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,585
A symbol for the German superiority.

212
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,639
Pilots are like gods, Richthofen.

213
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:46,692
After the death of Boelcke the troops have
lost their hero.

214
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,209
And if the enemy can shoot down our gods
than it is...

215
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,302
not  a very good motivation for all our
"ground workers" in the trenches, huh?

216
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,397
Gods don't die.

217
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,935
Do we understand each other?

218
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:04,868
Yes Sir.

219
00:25:05,724 --> 00:25:06,571
Good.

220
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:09,041
You can leave now, gentlemen.

221
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:23,232
General?

222
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:24,381
Yes?

223
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:26,618
Go on.

224
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:32,520
Can we perhaps have some croissants,
butter, marmalade and coffee?

225
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:41,896
Richthofen's parental home, Schweidnitz,
Germany

226
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:57,695
There you are!

227
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:00,758
Good morning mother.

228
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,012
I assume you've had a pleasant journey?

229
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:13,134
For how long are you going to wear
this old jacket, Manfred?

230
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,452
-There he is!
-Cousin, brother!

231
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:20,120
May I see it?

232
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,607
Sure, it's in the bag.

233
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,645
Look, he still has the old jacket, mother.

234
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:27,272
Come on!

235
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:28,832
I've already told him...

236
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:30,441
Stop harrassing me with your jacket!

237
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:32,254
Give me a hug.

238
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,054
-I still think that the jacket...
-Mom!

239
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:55,198
Welcome home, son.

240
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,058
They all came here in honour of our son.

241
00:27:34,476 --> 00:27:36,519
And what are they doing... play with the
plane.

242
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,852
Like young boys.

243
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:40,466
Do you think my brothers will ever become
adults?

244
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:42,013
Sweet little boys.

245
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:48,965
Let them play.

246
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:51,667
As long as they still can.

247
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:26,454
You told me you could fly.

248
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:28,586
But I can!

249
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:31,511
Wait until I sit in a real one.

250
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:33,603
You will see.

251
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:58,631
Richthofen's Squadron 11, Douai, France
January 1917

252
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,227
Always attack while having the sun behind
you.

253
00:29:01,554 --> 00:29:02,980
Don't shoot too soon.

254
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:05,933
It only warns your enemy and does nothing
else.

255
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:10,211
The best firing distance is 50 meters. Not
more.

256
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,811
But always remember:

257
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:16,186
Our objective is to shoot down planes, not
pilots.

258
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:19,514
Stop shooting when the plane is already
going down.

259
00:29:21,277 --> 00:29:22,870
Gentlemen, we are sportsmen.

260
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:25,056
Not butchers.

261
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:33,512
- Merci
- De rien

262
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,229
Gentlemen!

263
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:41,931
This is my chief mechanic...

264
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,530
Corporal Reuber.

265
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:49,119
Dismissed!

266
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:52,697
Captain!

267
00:29:53,498 --> 00:29:54,976
Stop clicking your heels, Wentzke.

268
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:56,883
Yes Sir!

269
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:00,977
-Hi.
-Oh, i almost forgot...

270
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:06,148
Whoever doesn't shoot down at
least one plane during the next weeks

271
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:07,460
will be fired.

272
00:30:17,227 --> 00:30:21,093
German field hospital, St.Nicholas, Belgium
the next day.

273
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:30,927
Lieutenant!

274
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,862
This is a hospital, who do you think you
are?

275
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:08,681
I'm dreadfully sorry.

276
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:10,430
Did you know him well?

277
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:17,104
I still don't know your name...

278
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:20,283
Käte Otersdorf

279
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:23,258
Un nom allemand, a german name?

280
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,070
My father was German, my mother is Belgian.

281
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:28,445
I see.

282
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,445
I love these french cigarettes.

283
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:43,931
You are...

284
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,179
...a very beautiful woman.

285
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:50,930
I hoped to see you again.

286
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,209
And that you would perhaps wear my scarf.

287
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,430
I will get it for you.

288
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:15,199
I wasn't able to wash out all of the stains.

289
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:17,671
Mademoiselle!

290
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:20,226
Have I done something wrong to you?

291
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,757
Am I not worthy of an answer
or do you hate all men?

292
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:24,868
Hate?

293
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,826
I don't hate you.

294
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:29,179
Hate is men's business.

295
00:32:29,936 --> 00:32:31,368
But you are angry aren't you?

296
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:35,312
There is somebody else's blood on your
scarf.

297
00:32:35,677 --> 00:32:37,368
But it seems not to bother you.

298
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,432
I'm scared of men like you because I can't
understand why you are like that.

299
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:45,616
And when I'm scared I get angry.

300
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:50,023
And now I'd like you to leave me alone.

301
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,241
Wait, WAIT.

302
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:56,366
Imagine you were there now.

303
00:32:57,086 --> 00:32:58,022
Like a falcon.

304
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,365
And you look down.

305
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:02,221
The wind is blowing in your face.

306
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:04,923
The smell and the noise of the engine and
propeller.

307
00:33:07,288 --> 00:33:09,168
There you can let yourself fall.

308
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:10,831
You can climb, do a barrell roll...

309
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:13,405
Freedom

310
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:16,913
That's what humans always dreamed of.

311
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:20,521
I already dreamed about it as a little dude.

312
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,574
But the best thing is:

313
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:25,307
Hunting!

314
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:26,583
The battle.

315
00:33:26,992 --> 00:33:28,228
The GAME!

316
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:30,669
It's like a match.

317
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,068
A tournament, just like in sports.

318
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:36,867
Tennis won't kill you.

319
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,288
Your silly dreams were the reason
for your friend's death.

320
00:33:45,678 --> 00:33:47,133
No, I don't hate you, Baron.

321
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:50,553
I just pity you.

322
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:58,307
Give me a break, Gentlemen!

323
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:00,656
It can't be that hard...

324
00:34:00,657 --> 00:34:02,211
to paint a fucking plane!

325
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:05,804
It was an order!

326
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:06,994
Reuber!

327
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:16,726
Manfred...

328
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:17,901
What's the matter with you?

329
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:20,693
What do you want with this stupid coloring?

330
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:24,854
The High Army Command will crucify you!

331
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:27,805
I don't care about the High Command.

332
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:29,920
And you better stop questioning my orders.

333
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:32,663
I just think it's a mistake.

334
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,816
They will see you already from 100 km away.

335
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:38,054
We are completely losing our element of
surprise.

336
00:34:38,055 --> 00:34:39,968
I don't want to surprise anybody, Sternberg.

337
00:34:41,442 --> 00:34:43,076
I want them to be scared.

338
00:34:53,118 --> 00:34:55,200
Captain! Lieutenant Kurt Wolff reporting in.

339
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:01,323
Are you planning to take a nap up there?

340
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:04,133
I never fly without this cap.

341
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:05,931
It's my lucky charm.

342
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:08,855
I also have one.

343
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:11,949
My mother keeps ordering new jackets.

344
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,459
But I never pick them up.

345
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:18,553
See you later.

346
00:35:34,804 --> 00:35:37,089
Six weeks later.

347
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:41,102
The general!

348
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,656
General von Höppner!

349
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:44,694
Look in this direction. Don't move.

350
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:46,056
Thank you.

351
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:52,794
You are quickly getting famous, Captain.

352
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:54,259
You are in the headlines.

353
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,741
The Kaiser himself has mentioned your name

354
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,243
after he heard about your 29th victory.

355
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:04,822
So...

356
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,484
I brought you a little surprise present...

357
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,829
aren't you becoming short of medals already?

358
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,594
Well, it's not really a medal.

359
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:17,310
Lieutenant...

360
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:25,746
It wasn't my idea.

361
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:27,746
After all it is good propaganda.

362
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:30,183
"The Richthofen Bros are flying together."

363
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:33,526
Welcome.

364
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,559
Your brother is a decent fellow.

365
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,473
He has all the right stuff that our
Fatherland needs at the moment.

366
00:36:40,016 --> 00:36:41,350
One question...

367
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,776
the people keep inventing strange names for
you...

368
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:44,978
"Le Diable Rouge"

369
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:46,663
Or "The Red Baron"

370
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:48,882
How come?

371
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:11,037
I see.

372
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:19,491
Impressive

373
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:22,621
Really impressive.

374
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,256
The sun always behind you...

375
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:35,737
Keep the wind direction in mind...

376
00:37:36,037 --> 00:37:36,975
And don't forget:

377
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,250
The most important virtue of a good pilot is
to know when to retreat.

378
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,351
What. Is that supposed to be a joke?

379
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:44,913
Just do as we say, Lothar.

380
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,631
Avoid the battle?

381
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:47,636
That's right.

382
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,759
-If you can't win you turn back.
-Immediately!

383
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,288
Intelligence and cowardice are very close.

384
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,354
It's true.

385
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Listen to him!

386
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:58,053
Good morning, gentlemen.

387
00:37:58,054 --> 00:37:59,495
It's a good idea.

388
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:03,249
I heard that the stupid French believe
the colour to be bullet proof.

389
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,130
I wouldn't take this with you.

390
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:14,180
It might be in your way up there.

391
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,929
Looks much better now.

392
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:37,129
The riding crop stays here, bro.

393
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:45,902
-That was pretty damn close.
-That was fun, wasn't it?

394
00:38:53,992 --> 00:38:55,620
Let's have dinner together tonight.

395
00:38:55,996 --> 00:38:57,591
-Werner feels ronery huh?
-Yes.

396
00:38:58,012 --> 00:38:59,975
Have you transferred him here?

397
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:01,324
Who?

398
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:02,942
Your brother Lothar.

399
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:05,911
Have you seen him? Where is he anyway?

400
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,671
He was behind me.

401
00:39:07,672 --> 00:39:09,527
You should keep an eye on him.

402
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:11,276
He has got a very unhealthy attitude.

403
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,085
Oh my god. Let him land.

404
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:24,272
Let him land!

405
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:35,584
Goddamnit, Lothar!

406
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:37,663
You have massacred the poor guy!

407
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:41,296
You think you can make our
father proud of you this way?

408
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:44,254
Dad had lost his sense of hearing
while saving the life of an enemy.

409
00:39:44,522 --> 00:39:46,739
So you want to win the war without killing
anybody?

410
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:52,703
I have watched Voss and you and
I don't like what I have seen.

411
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,761
You are all brilliant pilots.

412
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,368
But you have the wrong attitude.

413
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:01,561
What a stupid idea! Painting the plane in
bright red...

414
00:40:02,913 --> 00:40:03,959
Stop fantasizing!

415
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:06,196
This is no playgound.

416
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:08,185
We are no children, we are men.

417
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:09,694
And this is a fucking war.

418
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:11,449
I know that.

419
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:14,714
I know that very well!

420
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:17,842
But we can still fight with decency!

421
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,163
What now?

422
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:34,396
You heard it?

423
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:36,069
Even Paris has heard it

424
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,321
- ...and Berlin.
- Come on, he was just over-ambitious.

425
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:40,411
Then tell him to pull himself together in
the future.

426
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:43,151
I don't want to die only because your
brother is too ambitious.

427
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,500
And I also don't want
to see you kick the bucket.

428
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:21,940
Berlin, German imperial capital, May 1917

429
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,457
Good morning dear Hindenburg.

430
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,683
Ach, and my friend von Höppner.

431
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:14,852
Welcome to Berlin.

432
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:33,589
It seems the young man
is already more famous than...

433
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:36,186
what was his name?

434
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,898
-Oswald Boelcke, your majesty.
-Yes.

435
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:40,748
We need men like him.

436
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:42,335
I think...

437
00:42:43,129 --> 00:42:46,015
we should promote you once again.

438
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:51,928
You are a real hero.

439
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:59,862
I guess he can hardly keep
the young Fräuleins at bay?

440
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:03,269
There aren't many fans
at 3000 meters altitude, your majesty.

441
00:43:15,215 --> 00:43:17,311
Company, attention!

442
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:19,728
Are you ready, gentlemen?

443
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:37,725
Douai, Military Train Station,
German Occupied Territory

444
00:44:42,577 --> 00:44:43,652
Move on!

445
00:44:44,907 --> 00:44:45,932
Don't be so slow.

446
00:44:49,097 --> 00:44:50,361
Move on.

447
00:44:56,299 --> 00:44:57,237
Captain!

448
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,007
What shall we do now?

449
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:00,476
I could run them over.

450
00:45:01,394 --> 00:45:03,097
Put the fucking gun away.

451
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,860
What did he say?

452
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:08,516
He wants the Captain's signature.

453
00:45:21,673 --> 00:45:22,444
Ready!

454
00:45:22,445 --> 00:45:23,316
Go!

455
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:29,422
-Ready!
-Go!

456
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:35,177
How did you know?

457
00:45:35,578 --> 00:45:37,223
I thought you lost yours recently.

458
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:13,512
Good morning, gentlemen.

459
00:46:13,513 --> 00:46:14,708
Bodenschatz! Welcome!

460
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:16,335
My new adjutant.

461
00:46:16,336 --> 00:46:17,459
Kurt Wolff

462
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,590
-Pleased to meet you.
-I've heard much about you.

463
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:20,555
Thanks.

464
00:46:21,888 --> 00:46:23,176
Orders, Sternberg, orders.

465
00:46:23,456 --> 00:46:25,239
My new commanding officer is the same man

466
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,119
whom I commanded myself not too long ago.

467
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,419
How are the flying conditions over here?

468
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,246
I've heard that you have to deal
with massive allied forces here?

469
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,679
More than massive.

470
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,176
While we produce 10 German planes
they unload 100 planes at the french coast.

471
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:37,858
Let them come.

472
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:40,754
We'll have to shoot them by the hundreds.

473
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:43,707
Our bro Lothar...

474
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:48,410
British offensive near Ypres, Belgium

475
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:08,911
No! Damn!

476
00:51:10,238 --> 00:51:11,145
Bastards!

477
00:52:23,755 --> 00:52:28,057
7km to the south, no-man's-land

478
00:53:13,507 --> 00:53:14,650
Fucking moles.

479
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:18,337
I consider myself lucky that I didn't get
caught in one of their holes, too.

480
00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:20,811
Your sense of tact is flattering me.

481
00:53:20,812 --> 00:53:24,116
You perfect landing with shredded rudders
is already shameful enough for me.

482
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:28,029
I wanted to take a look at your Sopwith.
Brand new huh?

483
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,214
It was, earlier...

484
00:53:34,687 --> 00:53:36,552
The infamous Red Baron, I assume?

485
00:53:37,975 --> 00:53:40,226
Haven't I shot you down already last year?

486
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:42,211
Yes, you have.

487
00:53:42,558 --> 00:53:44,483
How come that you fly again?

488
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:48,289
Your prison camps are pretty comfortable
but they have no airfields.

489
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:53,758
I would have died without your help last
year.

490
00:53:59,126 --> 00:54:00,031
Thank you.

491
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:02,870
I didn't save your live.

492
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:05,742
True.

493
00:54:06,726 --> 00:54:10,030
Without her help I would have never
made it back into a plane.

494
00:54:10,031 --> 00:54:11,508
She's an awesome woman.

495
00:54:12,101 --> 00:54:13,913
She nursed me for weeks.

496
00:54:15,147 --> 00:54:16,482
Did you get your scarf back?

497
00:54:22,465 --> 00:54:23,820
What now?

498
00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:26,619
We could fight a duel with our pistols.

499
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,905
If I shot you I would become famous, too.

500
00:54:28,906 --> 00:54:31,509
I haven't got my pistol with me.
But you better close your holster

501
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,032
or you might lose your pistol, too.

502
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:50,149
How long have you already been in Europe?

503
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,349
Since Mother England asked her children for
help.

504
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:55,807
I mean us, the English Colonies.

505
00:54:57,066 --> 00:55:00,215
Well, the whole war seems to be a family
affair.

506
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,991
Especially you aristocrats seem to love it.

507
00:55:03,351 --> 00:55:06,130
The russian Tsar, the German Kaiser, the
English Monarchy.

508
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,216
France, Austria, Germany

509
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:11,698
Everybody is somebody's nephew, brother or
uncle.

510
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:13,882
Your love life certainly doesn't know
borders.

511
00:55:13,883 --> 00:55:16,535
And to secure these borders
we have to annihilate each other.

512
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:20,010
And some silly reasons can always be found.

513
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,432
You haven't opened your holster
because you were afraid?

514
00:55:31,445 --> 00:55:33,056
You have very good eyes.

515
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,509
Did you plan to shoot me?

516
00:55:37,382 --> 00:55:39,304
Aren't we here to shoot at each other?

517
00:55:42,383 --> 00:55:43,261
True.

518
00:55:47,353 --> 00:55:48,548
See you soon.

519
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:52,695
Don't get me wrong but I'd rather not.

520
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:57,779
True.

521
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:06,432
It was nice to meet you.

522
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,039
Good luck.

523
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:12,852
Speaking of family affairs...

524
00:56:14,086 --> 00:56:16,588
One day this war will hopefully be over.

525
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:19,444
So keep in touch with this nurse.

526
00:56:20,154 --> 00:56:21,804
I think she has a crush on you.

527
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,695
How do you know that?

528
00:56:25,976 --> 00:56:27,758
She kept cursing you for weeks.

529
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,259
Stop the car!

530
00:56:59,967 --> 00:57:01,107
Stop the car!

531
00:57:11,257 --> 00:57:12,822
There you are, we just found him.

532
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:25,352
Sterni.

533
00:57:27,728 --> 00:57:28,885
He needs a doctor!

534
00:57:29,344 --> 00:57:31,257
He doesn't need a doctor, he needs a priest.

535
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:33,445
A rabbi.

536
00:57:33,858 --> 00:57:34,857
Oh really?

537
00:58:05,778 --> 00:58:07,091
He's dead, Manfred.

538
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:27,069
Richthofen's Fighter Wing 1, Marcke, Belgium
4 days later

539
00:58:53,653 --> 00:58:54,653
I'm catching up slowly.

540
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:01,569
His funeral is now days ago.

541
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:16,742
Why are you not happy that I was promoted?
I am your brother.

542
00:59:32,212 --> 00:59:33,822
I know that he was your friend.

543
00:59:36,134 --> 00:59:37,525
But he was also a fighter pilot.

544
00:59:38,757 --> 00:59:40,008
He knew the risks.

545
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:45,678
Every soldier is proudly taking these risks.

546
00:59:47,494 --> 00:59:50,190
But you are more than a soldier,
you are a commanding officer!

547
00:59:52,228 --> 00:59:54,496
You have the responsibility for the men out
there!

548
00:59:55,212 --> 00:59:56,892
And your country, and your people!

549
01:00:05,464 --> 01:00:06,823
You know what dad used to say.

550
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,387
"An officer is not allowed to mourn."

551
01:01:22,757 --> 01:01:23,842
You have a nice odor.

552
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,534
Much better than all the flowers here.

553
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,132
German field hospital St. Nicholas, July
1917

554
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:35,792
You are still a little boy with silly ideas.

555
01:01:39,132 --> 01:01:40,420
You haven't changed.

556
01:01:43,249 --> 01:01:44,860
I'm not so sure.

557
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,716
I wouldn't have let them shoot
me down a while ago.

558
01:01:52,492 --> 01:01:53,226
Turn over.

559
01:02:11,383 --> 01:02:13,419
So much about "Germany's greatest Hero"

560
01:02:16,947 --> 01:02:20,600
I have enough of the bad news everyday.

561
01:02:22,222 --> 01:02:23,570
I'm just trying to act for you.

562
01:02:23,571 --> 01:02:25,382
You are sending out single fighter wings.

563
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,397
Doering.

564
01:02:27,545 --> 01:02:31,115
They cannot stand against the enemy
formations on their own!

565
01:02:31,962 --> 01:02:33,668
Lieutenant Doering has got his orders.

566
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:37,320
The High Army Command has ordered us
to fly with fixed schedules.

567
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,228
They are all idiots and retards.

568
01:02:39,852 --> 01:02:41,821
They want us to fly routine border patrols.

569
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,944
We have to be flexible.

570
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:45,091
Free.

571
01:02:45,616 --> 01:02:47,399
Being able to fight the enemy everywhere.

572
01:02:51,002 --> 01:02:54,611
The British and the French are controlling
the air wherever and whenever they like.

573
01:02:55,163 --> 01:02:55,854
We.

574
01:02:58,032 --> 01:03:00,653
We are hardly shooting
any of their fucking planes at all.

575
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:07,526
I order you to ignore
the orders of High Command, Doering.

576
01:03:48,305 --> 01:03:51,461
Mademoiselle Otersdorf?
What are you doing here?

577
01:03:52,806 --> 01:03:54,154
I just follow my orders, Baron.

578
01:03:57,022 --> 01:03:58,326
You were ordered to follow us?

579
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:00,335
Yes.

580
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:38,866
Hey Captain, nice to have you back again!

581
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:42,615
Welcome back.

582
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:06,118
The red ones belong to the 11th squadron.

583
01:05:08,342 --> 01:05:09,820
Yellow ones are the 10th squadron.

584
01:05:11,647 --> 01:05:13,197
Zebras are Nr 6.

585
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:15,021
Blacks are Nr 4.

586
01:05:16,165 --> 01:05:19,165
You have in front of you
the most successful fighter wing of the war.

587
01:05:19,988 --> 01:05:22,128
And over there you see the best pilots ever.

588
01:05:30,664 --> 01:05:32,360
I never thought that this would happen.

589
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:33,288
What?

590
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:35,411
That you would smile.

591
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:43,463
I thought you were not allowed to fly.

592
01:05:53,042 --> 01:05:54,917
Your little nurse looks really cute.

593
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:02,485
I may have a hole in the head but I'm not
blind.

594
01:06:06,424 --> 01:06:08,497
And I am already fit enough to punch you.

595
01:06:14,675 --> 01:06:15,695
What are you writing?

596
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:18,730
A book.

597
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,409
About flying.

598
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,739
What are you reading?

599
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:25,780
I never see you without a book.

600
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:27,770
At the moment:

601
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,225
Oscar Wilde

602
01:06:31,076 --> 01:06:32,180
Do you know his books?

603
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:37,470
No...

604
01:06:37,804 --> 01:06:40,331
I can't find British literature in there.

605
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:46,935
Try this:

606
01:06:50,123 --> 01:06:51,466
There must be

607
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:53,669
Shakespeare somewhere...

608
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,498
My father used to read it to us.

609
01:06:55,936 --> 01:06:56,685
Lear

610
01:06:56,686 --> 01:06:58,097
Comedy of Errors

611
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:00,623
Perhaps you can find some songs

612
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:03,140
and a bunch of billard related stuff

613
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:07,748
hunting, flying, horse-riding

614
01:07:07,997 --> 01:07:10,216
how to flirt.

615
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:21,487
It is easy to read the mind of somebody

616
01:07:21,488 --> 01:07:22,966
who has a hole in his head, Baron.

617
01:07:24,647 --> 01:07:25,686
so...

618
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:28,607
go on... ask.

619
01:07:35,935 --> 01:07:37,093
Would you...

620
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:40,640
Would you like to have a dinner with me?

621
01:07:42,496 --> 01:07:43,424
Yes.

622
01:07:45,903 --> 01:07:50,138
German occupied town of Lille, France

623
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,203
So?

624
01:08:16,252 --> 01:08:17,290
I have to admit...

625
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:19,513
I had expected something else.

626
01:08:21,851 --> 01:08:23,048
Something else?

627
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:25,077
What you write

628
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:28,106
is amusing

629
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:30,044
You thought it was boring.

630
01:08:30,748 --> 01:08:31,459
Stupid

631
01:08:31,824 --> 01:08:32,906
and deadly serious.

632
01:08:32,907 --> 01:08:33,406
No

633
01:08:34,685 --> 01:08:36,375
But you write about the war.

634
01:08:36,376 --> 01:08:38,561
I had expected some patriotism.

635
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,185
Patriotism.

636
01:08:42,426 --> 01:08:43,990
"...the virtue of the vicious."

637
01:08:48,077 --> 01:08:49,343
So you did read Wilde.

638
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,343
Even a bit of Dante.

639
01:08:52,636 --> 01:08:54,114
It would be helpful at the moment.

640
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:56,812
I mean...

641
01:08:57,934 --> 01:08:59,575
knowing a bit about Infernos.

642
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:03,094
Dance with me.

643
01:09:04,732 --> 01:09:05,576
No.

644
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:06,913
Better not.

645
01:09:08,163 --> 01:09:09,591
I am an awfully bad dancer.

646
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:11,873
Just imagine that we are flying.

647
01:09:50,765 --> 01:09:51,719
Marvellous.

648
01:09:54,311 --> 01:09:55,766
To have such a hole in the head.

649
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:00,748
Without it I wouldn't sit beside you now.

650
01:10:01,062 --> 01:10:01,996
Right?

651
01:10:03,862 --> 01:10:05,890
At the moment I am grounded.

652
01:10:09,982 --> 01:10:10,843
Mentzke?

653
01:10:12,328 --> 01:10:14,092
Could you turn around?

654
01:10:48,435 --> 01:10:50,076
There are so many hospitals

655
01:10:50,077 --> 01:10:52,114
they have to number them all the way
through.

656
01:10:52,924 --> 01:10:54,220
This is Nr 76

657
01:10:56,091 --> 01:10:57,582
There are 500 men here.

658
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:01,546
Most of them will die.

659
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,303
The rest will never be able to see again.

660
01:11:04,784 --> 01:11:05,468
Or walk.

661
01:11:06,426 --> 01:11:07,585
taste anything

662
01:11:08,402 --> 01:11:09,107
love

663
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:14,697
No, it is not marvellous to have
a hole in the head.

664
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,186
Consider yourself lucky to be alive.

665
01:11:20,436 --> 01:11:23,610
Only because of your origin you gain
benefits that the others don't have.

666
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:26,670
They have no choice.

667
01:11:27,655 --> 01:11:28,800
This isn't a game.

668
01:11:31,096 --> 01:11:33,096
Never before the world has seen bigger
beasts.

669
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:37,462
Never before was there greater horror.

670
01:12:50,285 --> 01:12:51,266
Come in.

671
01:13:08,928 --> 01:13:12,310
I need something for my headaches.

672
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:30,674
Go in the basement!

673
01:14:31,434 --> 01:14:32,278
Immediately!

674
01:14:33,434 --> 01:14:34,391
You also fly at night?

675
01:14:39,716 --> 01:14:40,499
Take you gas mask.

676
01:14:42,575 --> 01:14:43,720
You fly at night?

677
01:14:44,637 --> 01:14:45,701
No, we don't.

678
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:52,074
Here.

679
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:55,441
Find a save place.

680
01:14:59,851 --> 01:15:00,762
Turn off all lights.

681
01:15:02,213 --> 01:15:02,872
Give me that.

682
01:15:03,283 --> 01:15:04,457
The Army High Command, Sir.

683
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,576
Bodenschatz here.

684
01:15:06,185 --> 01:15:07,344
Turn off all the lights!

685
01:15:09,233 --> 01:15:10,109
Night bombers!

686
01:15:10,388 --> 01:15:11,403
Good morning Captain!

687
01:15:11,404 --> 01:15:12,388
Four of them already passed.

688
01:15:12,389 --> 01:15:13,375
Four others incoming.

689
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:15,028
Overall only eight, it could be worse.

690
01:15:15,813 --> 01:15:18,030
They didn't just accidentally a few bombs,
Doering.

691
01:15:18,701 --> 01:15:21,484
They know about this airfield and there
will be more than eight.

692
01:15:21,485 --> 01:15:22,420
Many more!

693
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:53,871
Good morning.

694
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:55,325
Good morning.

695
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,355
Wolff, how are you?

696
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:58,609
It's ok.

697
01:15:59,109 --> 01:16:00,611
All MG-Emplacements are manned.

698
01:16:01,074 --> 01:16:03,378
More can't be done to secure our
planes on the ground

699
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:04,658
Mentzke, bring my gear!

700
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:06,554
Prepare for take-off!

701
01:16:07,678 --> 01:16:09,200
You are injured, you can't fly yet!

702
01:16:09,201 --> 01:16:10,853
I won't let them butcher us like that.

703
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:12,090
I have wings.

704
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:08,352
Captain?

705
01:18:32,013 --> 01:18:33,810
Are you mad? You attacked them head-on!

706
01:18:35,473 --> 01:18:36,295
Bring me to her...

707
01:18:47,498 --> 01:18:48,609
Don't move.

708
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,423
Go and search for her.

709
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:53,253
I want to know if she's alright.

710
01:19:10,594 --> 01:19:11,642
You are gorgeous.

711
01:19:14,733 --> 01:19:17,045
Fokker has built us a very good new plane.

712
01:19:19,216 --> 01:19:20,825
Fast and maneuverable like the devil.

713
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:25,043
They climb like monkeys.

714
01:19:31,324 --> 01:19:32,734
I know you are angry with me.

715
01:19:57,185 --> 01:19:59,034
I was ordered to return to St. Nicholas.

716
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:01,371
I know.

717
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,076
I'm sorry for what happened
to Kurt Wolff.

718
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:15,737
He was a charming young man.

719
01:20:17,107 --> 01:20:19,157
He had forgotten his bed cap, you know.

720
01:20:19,418 --> 01:20:20,686
It was his lucky charm.

721
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:24,656
Baron...

722
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:27,735
Yes?

723
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:29,859
Have dinner with me again some day.

724
01:20:30,934 --> 01:20:33,553
And promise that you will always
wear your good-luck jacket.

725
01:20:55,559 --> 01:21:01,422
German fortification, Siegfried-Position,
northern France, November 1917

726
01:21:05,787 --> 01:21:06,906
We aren't late I hope.

727
01:21:07,151 --> 01:21:08,058
No, we aren't.

728
01:21:24,136 --> 01:21:24,721
The toilet?

729
01:21:24,722 --> 01:21:26,237
Down the stairs to the right, Sir.

730
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,326
Just a minute.

731
01:21:47,422 --> 01:21:48,496
Attention!

732
01:21:50,277 --> 01:21:51,842
Everything is going just as planned.

733
01:21:51,843 --> 01:21:53,482
-Yes
-Really satisfactory.

734
01:21:54,517 --> 01:21:55,243
Oh.

735
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,407
Our famous Fighter Ace

736
01:22:00,408 --> 01:22:02,138
is visiting us at the frontline!

737
01:22:04,072 --> 01:22:05,775
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

738
01:22:07,268 --> 01:22:09,701
A magnificient sight, isn't it.

739
01:22:09,702 --> 01:22:10,744
Richthofen.

740
01:22:12,744 --> 01:22:13,930
Your majesty...

741
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:18,017
Your majesty!

742
01:22:19,024 --> 01:22:20,164
The little brother.

743
01:22:22,549 --> 01:22:24,901
You look unwell, my dear Baron.

744
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:27,420
Yes, your majesty.

745
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:29,342
But I'm fine.

746
01:22:30,434 --> 01:22:31,669
As always.

747
01:22:32,876 --> 01:22:35,013
Sometimes perhaps disconcertingly.

748
01:22:37,377 --> 01:22:39,542
How is it possible to be "disconcertingly
fine"?!

749
01:22:40,735 --> 01:22:42,170
It sometimes happens around here.

750
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:45,434
We kill some of their men.

751
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,625
And while they go down in flames we are
fine.

752
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,202
I find that irritating.

753
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:03,560
My soldiers, Richthofen...

754
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:05,624
don't kill other men.

755
01:23:06,661 --> 01:23:08,528
They are simply destroying the enemy.

756
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:10,809
Well,

757
01:23:11,044 --> 01:23:12,949
the outcome seems to be the same.

758
01:23:16,857 --> 01:23:20,925
Richthofen's Fighter Wing 1,
Avesnes-Le-Sec, France

759
01:23:26,264 --> 01:23:27,358
Yes, Mentzke?

760
01:23:27,965 --> 01:23:29,277
You have a guest, Captain.

761
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:38,152
I thought we should celebrate.

762
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:47,403
They published your book!

763
01:23:51,552 --> 01:23:53,342
It will be read in the whole of Europe.

764
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:55,624
So...

765
01:23:55,955 --> 01:23:57,855
are we having dinner tonight?

766
01:23:58,392 --> 01:23:59,684
And dance?

767
01:24:00,497 --> 01:24:02,073
The "Metropole" was closed.

768
01:24:02,307 --> 01:24:03,795
Yes, because of their kitchen.

769
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:05,949
An English bomb destroyed it.

770
01:24:10,965 --> 01:24:12,113
These bloody Englishmen.

771
01:24:12,762 --> 01:24:15,892
They will only stop when everything
will taste as bad as their own food.

772
01:24:31,394 --> 01:24:32,572
They don't want me to fly.

773
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:39,259
They do everything possible to keep me
grounded.

774
01:24:40,636 --> 01:24:41,488
Really?

775
01:24:46,278 --> 01:24:48,378
I am supposed to command the whole Air
Force.

776
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,553
It's an order by the Kaiser.

777
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:53,858
That is wonderful.

778
01:24:55,177 --> 01:24:56,733
I woke up so often during the night

779
01:24:56,734 --> 01:24:58,552
and read

780
01:24:58,553 --> 01:25:00,553
the lists of pilots who are missing in
action.

781
01:25:05,378 --> 01:25:07,615
It is so good to know that you are grounded.

782
01:25:08,552 --> 01:25:09,632
In safety.

783
01:25:21,193 --> 01:25:21,980
Good.

784
01:25:35,943 --> 01:25:38,160
Your dancing skills are already much better,
Baron.

785
01:25:43,325 --> 01:25:45,302
I have to look out for alternatives anyway.

786
01:26:01,771 --> 01:26:03,597
-Good evening guys.
-Good evening Captain.

787
01:26:03,598 --> 01:26:05,242
-Pretty cold huh?
-Too right.

788
01:26:11,947 --> 01:26:13,441
A brand new Bentley Engine...

789
01:26:14,848 --> 01:26:16,115
Where did you find that?

790
01:26:17,365 --> 01:26:19,104
Bentleys don't simply fall from the sky.

791
01:26:19,276 --> 01:26:21,676
Believe me, the guy didn't give it
to me by choice.

792
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:49,248
You always wanted to be the Ace of Aces.

793
01:26:50,115 --> 01:26:51,941
Now they offer it to you and you hesitate.

794
01:26:52,935 --> 01:26:53,688
Yes...

795
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:57,391
I always wanted to be like him.

796
01:27:01,008 --> 01:27:01,776
Werner?

797
01:27:05,797 --> 01:27:07,449
Would you ever be able to quit flying?

798
01:27:10,248 --> 01:27:11,298
Never.

799
01:27:13,277 --> 01:27:14,842
But if you want to hear my advice...

800
01:27:15,572 --> 01:27:16,882
accept the offer.

801
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:19,598
You just want me to quit

802
01:27:19,599 --> 01:27:21,304
so that you will become number one.

803
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,330
Finally you realize.

804
01:27:24,986 --> 01:27:25,949
Alright.

805
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:29,249
-I quit.
-Good.

806
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:31,617
If you quit first.

807
01:27:33,407 --> 01:27:34,344
Forget it.

808
01:27:34,345 --> 01:27:35,866
I am married to my plane.

809
01:27:36,276 --> 01:27:38,304
I pass every free minute with her.

810
01:27:44,782 --> 01:27:48,625
Fokker Factory, Schwerin, Germany.

811
01:27:49,076 --> 01:27:51,830
You are constructing
marvellous Planes here, Fokker.

812
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:53,221
-The best.
-Thank you.

813
01:27:53,921 --> 01:27:58,749
But somehow our own pilots think
they could build even better ones.

814
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:01,127
Well,

815
01:28:01,658 --> 01:28:03,927
sometimes we tune them a bit.

816
01:28:04,797 --> 01:28:06,627
-Here and there.
- Tuning is one thing...

817
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:09,797
...but replacing our engines with enemy
engines...

818
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:11,424
Where did you hear that?

819
01:28:11,425 --> 01:28:13,316
Just recently we got a report

820
01:28:13,317 --> 01:28:16,488
about the recovery of a triplane that had
been shot down.

821
01:28:17,596 --> 01:28:20,515
Well, the British found it very interesting

822
01:28:20,516 --> 01:28:23,657
that there was a Bentley Engine in a Fokker.

823
01:28:28,295 --> 01:28:29,952
-I want to see it.
-Of course.

824
01:28:29,953 --> 01:28:31,600
I want to see it immediately.

825
01:28:31,601 --> 01:28:34,094
Show me this fucking report immediately.

826
01:28:56,577 --> 01:28:58,751
Schweidnitz, Germany

827
01:29:14,249 --> 01:29:15,624
Only three weeks left, Manfred.

828
01:29:16,163 --> 01:29:17,861
I already got my marching orders.

829
01:29:18,076 --> 01:29:19,598
I will be in your fighter squadron!

830
01:29:21,732 --> 01:29:23,593
And what happened to this guy?

831
01:29:24,658 --> 01:29:26,062
Killed in action.

832
01:29:30,162 --> 01:29:31,359
And this one?

833
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,630
His name is Voss, right?

834
01:29:39,276 --> 01:29:40,356
They are all dead.

835
01:29:49,526 --> 01:29:51,302
I will fight on your and Lothar's side!

836
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:53,803
Our great offensive is prepared with full
intensity.

837
01:29:54,294 --> 01:29:56,033
They are calling it "Operation Michael".

838
01:29:56,344 --> 01:29:57,688
We will win this war, right?

839
01:29:58,072 --> 01:29:59,360
Wolfram, please...

840
01:29:59,907 --> 01:30:01,044
It's ok, dad.

841
01:30:01,045 --> 01:30:02,625
Of course we are winning.

842
01:30:02,626 --> 01:30:04,635
The allies have no clue what is awaiting
them.

843
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:11,013
We flew on patrol for weeks.

844
01:30:11,525 --> 01:30:13,090
And we shot down their recon planes.

845
01:30:13,511 --> 01:30:15,511
They have no clue where we will break
through.

846
01:30:17,056 --> 01:30:18,798
We are prepared optimally.

847
01:30:20,901 --> 01:30:22,906
This offensive will finally annihilate them.

848
01:30:41,262 --> 01:30:45,107
German position, western front, France
February 1918

849
01:30:47,448 --> 01:30:48,535
Good morning Captain!

850
01:30:55,315 --> 01:30:55,970
Captain!

851
01:30:55,971 --> 01:30:57,056
Follow us!

852
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:10,065
Take cover!

853
01:31:36,906 --> 01:31:38,400
Now that's an unexpected pleasure!

854
01:31:40,655 --> 01:31:44,152
You came to witness another British defeat,
Captain?

855
01:31:45,267 --> 01:31:46,032
Adjutant!

856
01:31:46,305 --> 01:31:48,102
Find somebody with a photo-camera.

857
01:31:49,781 --> 01:31:50,855
It's good propaganda.

858
01:31:52,604 --> 01:31:54,920
Our fighter ace down here with us.

859
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:56,726
On the day of victory.

860
01:31:58,199 --> 01:31:59,419
Your excellency,

861
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:00,668
we should talk.

862
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:05,840
You wouldn't want to have me down here.

863
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:09,420
If you want me to have strategic competence

864
01:32:10,004 --> 01:32:11,324
you won't like it afterwards.

865
01:32:13,845 --> 01:32:15,087
And why not?

866
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:18,683
We have the greatest confidence
in your abilites, Baron.

867
01:32:19,306 --> 01:32:20,868
Then let us surrender.

868
01:32:23,589 --> 01:32:25,715
I don't have enough time for jokes.

869
01:32:27,324 --> 01:32:29,696
I've had 73 aerial victories.

870
01:32:29,906 --> 01:32:31,698
Do you know how I managed to do that?

871
01:32:32,438 --> 01:32:34,309
If I couldn't win a dogfight

872
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:36,041
I would turn around and flee.

873
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,481
And why do you believe that
we can't win this war?

874
01:32:40,062 --> 01:32:41,576
And our Fatherland?

875
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,650
Our German values?

876
01:32:43,982 --> 01:32:45,591
Our men out there in the battlefield.

877
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:48,207
Do you want to leave them to the enemy?

878
01:32:48,619 --> 01:32:50,587
Throw them at the feet of the enemy?

879
01:32:52,156 --> 01:32:53,281
French ones...

880
01:32:55,197 --> 01:32:56,885
the best cigarettes

881
01:32:59,499 --> 01:33:01,312
Why do we presume

882
01:33:01,746 --> 01:33:04,187
that our values are better than French ones?

883
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,727
Or better than the British or American
values?

884
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,908
They aren't better.

885
01:33:10,907 --> 01:33:12,931
There isn't even a difference.

886
01:33:13,571 --> 01:33:16,271
We all just need an excuse
for what we are doing.

887
01:33:16,272 --> 01:33:17,657
or else

888
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:20,635
we would see who we really are.

889
01:33:25,104 --> 01:33:27,186
Put this guy in a plane again!

890
01:33:29,196 --> 01:33:30,562
With a parachute.

891
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:34,220
I can't afford to lose another hero.

892
01:33:43,433 --> 01:33:46,163
Avesnes-Le-Sec, France, March 1918

893
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:48,625
Operation Michael

894
01:33:53,307 --> 01:33:55,760
Our infantry is attacking from two
directions

895
01:33:55,761 --> 01:33:57,743
At St. Quentin, here and here.

896
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,297
The main battle line would be 70 km long.

897
01:34:00,298 --> 01:34:01,838
That's right.

898
01:34:03,526 --> 01:34:04,338
Three armies.

899
01:34:06,022 --> 01:34:07,995
The 2nd Army and the 17th Army

900
01:34:07,996 --> 01:34:09,654
start the offensive here.

901
01:34:10,356 --> 01:34:12,433
The 18th army is going to advance here.

902
01:34:13,403 --> 01:34:15,248
Our task is to win aerial superiority of

903
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:17,299
the airspace and remain in control of it.

904
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:20,527
That's no problem at all, or is it
Bodenschatz?

905
01:34:20,884 --> 01:34:23,049
They have four times more planes than us,
Udet.

906
01:34:25,956 --> 01:34:28,043
We were struggling with them already for
months.

907
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:31,666
It will be worse than ever.

908
01:34:34,351 --> 01:34:35,953
They will send everything they have.

909
01:34:50,098 --> 01:34:50,927
Fucking cold.

910
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:41,696
What the hell are you doing?

911
01:35:43,284 --> 01:35:44,806
Excuse the disturbance, Lieutenant.

912
01:35:45,415 --> 01:35:47,502
What do you want with the picture of my
brother?

913
01:35:48,008 --> 01:35:49,356
He ordered me to take them off.

914
01:35:50,683 --> 01:35:51,662
All of his pictures.

915
01:35:53,138 --> 01:35:53,959
Sir.

916
01:36:04,504 --> 01:36:05,731
Move out!

917
01:38:17,082 --> 01:38:18,367
May god help us.

918
01:38:30,892 --> 01:38:31,851
Gentlemen.

919
01:38:34,397 --> 01:38:35,123
Let's go!

920
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:56,272
Ignition!

921
01:42:59,919 --> 01:43:01,047
He really returned.

922
01:43:02,936 --> 01:43:05,933
His Flying Circus has swept
the Brits out of the sky!

923
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,219
He passed over us.

924
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:10,498
He waved at us.

925
01:43:19,594 --> 01:43:22,967
Richthofen's Fighter Squadron1, Cappy,
France

926
01:43:36,247 --> 01:43:36,936
Captain!

927
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:48,014
Gentlemen!

928
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:54,378
The High Command in northern sector wants
to thank us.

929
01:43:54,436 --> 01:43:56,434
I want to thank you, too.

930
01:43:56,787 --> 01:43:58,590
You fought outstandingly.

931
01:43:58,908 --> 01:43:59,703
Thank you.

932
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,105
Thank you Captain.

933
01:44:51,971 --> 01:44:54,536
That's not how you pictured your
famous cousin, am i right?

934
01:44:57,363 --> 01:45:00,034
The glorious Captain that
you have seen on photos.

935
01:45:01,018 --> 01:45:02,540
The biggest hero of the Fatherland.

936
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:05,584
The ace of aces with 80 victories.

937
01:45:07,621 --> 01:45:09,447
Nobody else has shot down so many of them.

938
01:45:11,342 --> 01:45:12,907
I am really proud to be his brother.

939
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,954
You don't have a chance against this
family, Udet.

940
01:45:23,058 --> 01:45:23,888
Peace?

941
01:45:56,888 --> 01:45:57,955
Is that one of yours?

942
01:46:00,641 --> 01:46:01,728
I don't remember anymore.

943
01:46:03,558 --> 01:46:04,779
You are flying again, right?

944
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:09,435
Why did you hide it.

945
01:46:10,623 --> 01:46:12,428
Why did you lie to me again?

946
01:46:32,612 --> 01:46:33,801
I didn't want to worry you.

947
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:35,610
I just want that you are happy.

948
01:46:36,921 --> 01:46:38,999
Käthe, I can't do what they want from me.

949
01:46:39,532 --> 01:46:41,074
They offered you security.

950
01:46:41,715 --> 01:46:42,684
Your life.

951
01:46:48,623 --> 01:46:49,753
When I was a little boy...

952
01:46:51,058 --> 01:46:53,362
I could hit every target with
the rifle of my father.

953
01:46:55,937 --> 01:46:58,051
Targets that the others couldn't see
anymore.

954
01:47:00,082 --> 01:47:02,208
I dreamed of seeing everything.

955
01:47:02,574 --> 01:47:03,809
Like a bird.

956
01:47:04,969 --> 01:47:05,771
Falcon eye.

957
01:47:06,829 --> 01:47:08,137
"Eagle eye" was my nickname.

958
01:47:10,186 --> 01:47:11,389
When I became a pilot

959
01:47:12,831 --> 01:47:15,222
I really thought that I could see
everything from above

960
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:18,873
I saw nothing.

961
01:47:19,858 --> 01:47:22,013
I was blind before I met you.

962
01:47:23,558 --> 01:47:24,895
You opened my eyes.

963
01:47:26,058 --> 01:47:27,872
You showed me what I didn't want to see.

964
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,719
We all just wanted to fly.

965
01:47:32,656 --> 01:47:34,622
Voss, Sternberg...

966
01:47:34,623 --> 01:47:36,420
Lehmann, Wolff...

967
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:38,096
Hawker

968
01:47:39,013 --> 01:47:41,453
No matter which side, we all knew the risks.

969
01:47:45,183 --> 01:47:46,547
I wanted to be the best.

970
01:47:48,117 --> 01:47:49,856
I wanted to win and I assumed I had won.

971
01:47:50,219 --> 01:47:51,638
But now I can see, Käthe.

972
01:47:51,639 --> 01:47:54,378
I can see now that we turned the world into
a slaughterhouse.

973
01:47:54,379 --> 01:47:56,498
And I have already contributed too much

974
01:47:58,093 --> 01:48:00,881
They are faking hope with my photo

975
01:48:00,882 --> 01:48:02,361
where there is no hope left.

976
01:48:02,362 --> 01:48:03,908
They use my name.

977
01:48:03,909 --> 01:48:05,403
To pretend that there is immortality

978
01:48:05,404 --> 01:48:07,685
although there is only pain and death left.

979
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,513
You said it yourself:

980
01:48:10,128 --> 01:48:11,998
"The men who die out there have no choice."

981
01:48:12,266 --> 01:48:13,178
I have.

982
01:48:13,676 --> 01:48:15,406
I can't simply order them into battle.

983
01:48:16,391 --> 01:48:18,031
I can perhaps lead them out there.

984
01:48:18,032 --> 01:48:19,110
Help them.

985
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:20,236
Die with them.

986
01:48:20,237 --> 01:48:22,783
But I will never betray them or hide the
truth.

987
01:48:22,784 --> 01:48:25,236
by playing an immortal God in Berlin.

988
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:31,800
You

989
01:48:32,513 --> 01:48:33,951
You are my biggest victory.

990
01:48:54,289 --> 01:48:55,689
Captain?

991
01:48:57,734 --> 01:48:58,813
Excuse me please.

992
01:49:00,594 --> 01:49:01,512
Capt...

993
01:49:04,314 --> 01:49:07,578
Captain, an enemy squadron is approaching
the front line

994
01:49:08,235 --> 01:49:08,888
Thank you.

995
01:49:10,138 --> 01:49:10,797
Sir.

996
01:49:31,046 --> 01:49:32,076
Yes, thank you.

997
01:49:40,077 --> 01:49:41,968
They were sighted a Lagnycourt.

998
01:49:42,724 --> 01:49:43,928
That means...

999
01:49:43,929 --> 01:49:45,499
They are coming from north west.

1000
01:49:46,662 --> 01:49:47,654
Thank you.

1001
01:49:48,563 --> 01:49:49,600
Brother.

1002
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:52,144
How about me leading Nr 11 and you fly to
my right?

1003
01:49:52,813 --> 01:49:53,974
It will be my pleasure.

1004
01:49:54,665 --> 01:49:55,387
Wolfram

1005
01:49:56,514 --> 01:49:58,123
You avoid every dogfight!

1006
01:49:58,640 --> 01:49:59,764
Stay near to Lothar.

1007
01:50:00,252 --> 01:50:01,794
If you are attacked you fly back!

1008
01:50:02,389 --> 01:50:03,347
And fast.

1009
01:50:04,887 --> 01:50:06,800
Intelligence and cowardice are very close.

1010
01:50:24,529 --> 01:50:25,733
A nice day to fly.

1011
01:50:29,591 --> 01:50:30,982
You are a courageous man, Baron.

1012
01:50:36,889 --> 01:50:38,250
A very courageous man...

1013
01:52:48,315 --> 01:52:49,288
Ignition!

1014
01:53:59,176 --> 01:54:02,440
Allied territory, northern France

1015
01:54:02,441 --> 01:54:05,326
two weeks later

1016
01:54:33,203 --> 01:54:33,848
Thank you.

1017
01:54:34,189 --> 01:54:35,234
You are welcome.

1018
01:54:36,922 --> 01:54:38,055
Mademoiselle.

1019
01:55:25,834 --> 01:55:27,564
I wanted to visit you much earlier.

1020
01:55:29,244 --> 01:55:32,250
But it wasn't easy to get into allied
territory.

1021
01:55:36,127 --> 01:55:38,093
But then our friend helped me.

1022
01:55:42,703 --> 01:55:44,964
He asked me why it is important for me to
come here?

1023
01:55:47,938 --> 01:55:49,425
I told him I love you.

1024
01:55:53,127 --> 01:55:55,178
Did I ever tell you?

1025
01:57:10,831 --> 01:57:13,657
Manfred von Richthofen

1026
01:57:13,658 --> 01:57:16,922
The most successful pilot
of ww1 with 80 victories

1027
01:57:16,923 --> 01:57:19,968
Shot down on 21. April 1918
being 25 years old.

1028
01:57:19,969 --> 01:57:24,312
He was buried with military
honors by the allies.

1029
01:57:25,649 --> 01:57:33,064
Kate Otersdorf, nothing is known about her
life after the war

1030
01:57:35,484 --> 01:57:41,085
Captain Roy Brown. He was then believed
to be the one who shot down Richthofen

1031
01:57:41,086 --> 01:57:45,471
But until now nobody knows exactly how the
Red Baron died.

1032
01:57:45,472 --> 01:57:47,804
Captain Brown died of a heart attack in 1944

1033
01:57:47,805 --> 01:57:50,564
Lothar von Richthofen survived ww1

1034
01:57:50,565 --> 01:57:53,738
He had a fatal accident on July 4 1922

1035
01:57:53,739 --> 01:57:57,521
while landing a transport plan in Hamburg.

1036
01:58:01,268 --> 01:58:05,815
Werner Voss, Fighter Ace and one of
Richthofen's best friends

1037
01:58:05,816 --> 01:58:11,226
He got 48 victories before he was shot down
on September 23 1917

1038
01:58:13,515 --> 01:58:17,487
Kurt Wolff, 33 Kills, shot down on
September 15 1917.

1039
01:58:17,488 --> 01:58:24,207
He forgot to take his bedcap on his last
flight.

1040
01:58:24,688 --> 01:58:29,210
Many jewish pilots fought for the German
Reich in ww1

1041
01:58:29,211 --> 01:58:35,984
They are all represented by the fictional
character of Friedrich Sternberg

1042
01:58:37,499 --> 01:58:40,585
Wolfram von Richthofen, Richthofen's cousin
fought during

1043
01:58:40,586 --> 01:58:45,031
the last months of ww1 as a pilot

1044
01:58:45,032 --> 01:58:48,220
until Germany surrendered on November 1918
