00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:03,803
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

4
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:06,401
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

5
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:10,318
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

6
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:12,916
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

7
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:16,912
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

8
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:19,590
Jurek, where have you been
hiding her?

9
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,474
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

10
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,829
How many suitcases are you taking?

11
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,708
What do you think, should I take
uncle Szymon's portrait?

12
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:37,155
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

13
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,882
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

14
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:41,761
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

15
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,047
- I should have another case.
- Mama, Wladek is home!

16
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:50,363
Thank God.
Wladek! You're wounded?

17
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:53,760
- No, it was nothing.
- I've been worried sick.

18
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,448
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

19
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,926
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd know where to take you.

20
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:03,632
Henryk, don't say things like that.
God forbid. God forbid.

21
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,095
- Papa, Wladek is home.
- What did I tell you?

22
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:09,367
- What are you doing?
- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

23
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:14,792
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.
- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

24
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,790
Pack, darling.
Get your things packed.

25
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,098
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw.

26
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:22,076
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

27
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:24,734
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?
- No.

28
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:27,541
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

29
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:30,299
- She used it for packing.
- The government has moved to Lublin.

30
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,825
All able-bodied men must leave the city, go
across the river, set up a new line of defense.

31
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:39,281
There isn't anybody left here, only
the women. The men are all gone.

32
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:42,148
What do you think you'll do while
they set up a new line of defense?

33
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,605
- Wonder around with your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

34
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:49,442
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

35
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:52,160
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,597
Look, look. If I'm going to die, I prefer
to die in my own home, staying put.

37
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:59,473
- God forbid.
- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

38
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:03,387
From the BBC in London.
The British government...

39
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:08,416
having received no reply
to the ultimatum presented...

40
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:11,323
to the German government...

41
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:15,110
has declared war on Nazi Germany.

42
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:19,276
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

43
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:29,338
within the next few hours, France
will make a similar declaration.

44
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:32,285
Poland is no longer alone.

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,638
Wonderful, wonderful!

46
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:45,883
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- It certainly was.

47
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,631
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

48
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:51,718
Well, here's to Great Britain and France!

49
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:55,715
I told you, didn't I tell you?
All will be well!

50
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,274
Five thousand and three.

51
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:36,949
- Is that all?
- Yes. It's all we've got left.

52
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,837
- It's 3,003 too much.
- Look.

53
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:43,064
Re: "Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets".

54
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:47,140
Jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2,000 zlotys in their homes."

55
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,816
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

56
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:55,613
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

57
00:05:55,773 --> 00:06:00,799
We could hide the money. Look here.
We can hide it under the flowerpots.

58
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,856
No, no... I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use tried and tested methods.

59
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:05,634
You know what we did
in the last war?

60
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:10,490
We made a hole in the table leg,
and hid the money in there.

61
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,298
And suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean take the table away?

62
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:18,044
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take
what they want... furniture, valuables, anything.

63
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:20,871
- Do they?
- Why'd they want a table like this?

64
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,958
- What on earth are you doing?
- Listen. Look.

65
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:29,114
This is the best place. No-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot.

66
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:32,761
- No, listen. I've been thinking...
- Really? That's a change.

67
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:36,018
You know what we do? We use psychology.
- We use what?

68
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:41,284
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, covered. In full view.

69
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,398
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will search high and low... they'll never notice it.

70
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:51,355
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

71
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:53,443
Look here.

72
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:55,981
Idiot.

73
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:59,058
- And you call me stupid.
- Very good. That's the last place...

74
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:01,097
- This would take hours.
- We're not in a hurry.

75
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,873
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me.

76
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:08,240
- How will you get them out?
- Quiet! Order, please!

77
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,938
- You reach them out individually.
- No-one listens to me!

78
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:13,666
Quiet, please, quiet.
Order, order, please.

79
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:18,781
- The lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look.

80
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:22,028
The watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin.

81
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:28,473
- But I'll still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

82
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:32,310
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

83
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,817
We're fine, thank you.
And you?

84
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:39,663
Fine, under the circumstances.
I guess I know why you're calling.

85
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:43,860
There's nothing we can do.
They won't reopen the station.

86
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:49,605
- Yes, I know, but I...
- No music, no radio for the Polish.

87
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:52,862
But sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you.

88
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,529
Well, maybe, maybe not, but...

89
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:01,145
don't be offended, but I didn't call
to discuss my future career.

90
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:04,422
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

91
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:07,619
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
so I came and...

92
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:10,287
they bombed the station.

93
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:14,703
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.
- Really?

94
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:18,170
Yes, it was unforgettable.

95
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,847
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.

96
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:25,164
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope it's a compliment.

97
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:29,240
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

98
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,656
- Should we go and have a coffee?
- I'd like that.

99
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:38,772
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

100
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:42,309
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

101
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,947
- What instrument?
- The cello.

102
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:47,664
I love to see women
playing the cello.

103
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:51,901
JEWS FORBIDDEN

104
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,428
This is disgraceful.
How dare they?

105
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,505
You know what people are like, they
want to be better Nazis than Hitler.

106
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:02,262
- I'm going in there to complain.
- It's better not, believe me.

107
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:06,158
- It's so humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye.

108
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:12,923
We'll find somewhere else.

109
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:16,280
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

110
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:19,637
Official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

111
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,334
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

112
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:28,249
We could sit in a bench, but
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

113
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,417
This is absurd.

114
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:36,892
We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that
don't you?

115
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:42,007
So, you play the cello. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer?

116
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:44,335
Chopin? Really? Well...

117
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:47,293
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

118
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:50,070
What about you, Wladek?

119
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,557
Perhaps I could accompany.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

120
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:57,814
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

121
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:01,541
Call me Wladek, please.

122
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,297
"Free emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

123
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:08,794
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

124
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:12,111
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

125
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:17,447
This decree will come into force
on the first of December, 1939...

126
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:20,924
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

127
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:24,171
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

128
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:28,517
and will represent the blue star
of David on a white background.

129
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:32,214
The background must be
sufficiently large...

130
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,510
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

131
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,986
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

132
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:46,342
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

133
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:51,597
Governor of the Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer."

134
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:58,791
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

135
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:05,375
Let me see this.

136
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:12,879
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

137
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:18,174
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them.

138
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:29,105
You!

139
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,722
Come here.

140
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:40,675
Why haven't you greeted us?

141
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:43,592
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:57,380
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

143
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,578
Go into the gulley.

144
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:19,541
- Have you seen this?
- What? What? I'm working. What?

145
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,738
What is this?

146
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:27,704
- It's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean "put us"?

147
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:34,034
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

148
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:37,546
concerning the establishment of
the Jewish district in Warsaw.

149
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:44,290
There'll be created a Jewish district
in which Jews will have to reside."

150
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:48,366
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area...

151
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:53,782
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31 of October, 1940."

152
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,158
They won't get all of us.
It's too small.

153
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:00,326
There's 400 thousand of us
in Warsaw.

154
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:03,683
No, 360 thousand.
So it will be easy.

155
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,640
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me.

156
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:13,355
Mama?

157
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,772
Mama, what is it?

158
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,158
20 zlotys!

159
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:24,435
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

160
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:31,199
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

161
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:36,675
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

162
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:46,406
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

163
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,204
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

164
00:13:49,404 --> 00:13:53,920
- But it's a Bechstein!
- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

165
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,737
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

166
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:59,575
- Get out!
- What's the matter with you?

167
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,202
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

168
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:05,390
Haven't you eaten today?
What are you suffering from?

169
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:08,357
You people are crazy.

170
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:12,284
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

171
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,822
I'm not even charging
for the removal!

172
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:18,139
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy.

173
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,637
Take it.

174
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:56,825
Hello.

175
00:14:58,224 --> 00:15:00,142
Hello. Hi.

176
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,878
I didn't want to come.

177
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:09,514
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

178
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:11,553
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

179
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:13,671
Good.

180
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,388
No, not really.
They arrested my cousin.

181
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,325
Jurek says they'll let him out.

182
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:25,920
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

183
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,958
That's what I said myself.

184
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:32,255
It's too absurd.

185
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:39,089
I... I should go.

186
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,725
Well, I'll see you...

187
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:46,103
soon.

188
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,617
Good-bye.

189
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,943
Well...

190
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:13,019
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

191
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:23,750
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

192
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,327
You, Henryk and Papa, in here.

193
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:31,224
Look.

194
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:34,371
Come and look.

195
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:08,142
Go away.

196
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:10,849
Go away! Go away!

197
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:15,465
Papa! Papa!

198
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:34,469
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

199
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:37,187
- 3 zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

200
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:41,463
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

201
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:44,221
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

202
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,157
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

203
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:52,993
They bring cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

204
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:55,591
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

205
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:59,647
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

206
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:03,484
A tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard.

207
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:08,000
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

208
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,956
Sleep well. But if you see him,
write to me, yes?

209
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:14,474
Izaak Szerman.

210
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,729
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

211
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:35,007
Why can't they go around?

212
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:38,763
Don't worry. They're about to build
a bridge. Haven't you heard?

213
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,510
A bridge! Those idiots.

214
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,508
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

215
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:49,065
But do you know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.

216
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,931
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here...

217
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,889
waiting for them to let us through.

218
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,207
Maybe they think I come here
to listen to the music?

219
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:03,612
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

220
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:07,888
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

221
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,225
- Dance!
- Dance!

222
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:14,223
Come on, come on! Dance!

223
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,198
Yes, very nice... lol

224
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:22,176
What about you?
Dance with him.

225
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:27,651
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

226
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:32,007
Come on. And you.

227
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:40,480
Go on.

228
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:43,997
Faster!

229
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,595
Come on!

230
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:50,232
Faster!

231
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:54,548
Come on!

232
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,945
Faster!

233
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:04,539
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

234
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:07,617
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

235
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:29,628
Good, they're here.

236
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:34,104
Itzak Heller has been
waiting for you.

237
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:41,987
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

238
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:44,345
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

239
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,717
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

240
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:59,312
His father is back in the jewellery
business. He's doing well.

241
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:04,627
Amazing, jewellery.

242
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,445
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

243
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:10,003
Don't be clever with me.
I'm coming as a friend.

244
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,620
They're bringing Jews in
from all over the country.

245
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,859
Soon there will be half
million people in the ghetto.

246
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:18,775
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

247
00:21:18,975 --> 00:21:23,191
You want me to beat up Jews
and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

248
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,950
- Someone has got to do it.
- But why me?

249
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:27,747
I thought you only recruited boys
with rich fathers.

250
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,165
Look at my father, look at us...

251
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:33,363
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm
here. You can have a better life.

252
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:37,839
- You want to survive selling books?
- Yes, please.

253
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,536
I'm doing you people a favor.

254
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:43,574
What about you?
You're a great pianist.

255
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:45,932
We've got a police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.

256
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:49,169
- Join us. You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

257
00:22:39,206 --> 00:22:41,084
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

258
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:45,800
Who wants me to stop?
<i>(for just a minute)</i>

259
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,074
I always say,
look on the bright side.

260
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,041
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

261
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:45,888
You're better off than us. Here in
the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

262
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:48,985
- You have to give me something.
- You're an artist...

263
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:51,643
you keep peoples' spirits up.
You do enough.

264
00:23:51,783 --> 00:23:55,400
- I want to help, do something.
- You're too well known.

265
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,415
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

266
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:04,112
You're too... too musical.

267
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:11,985
- Who is that?
- Symche.

268
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,824
Majorek.

269
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:18,300
There are notices going up. City is
to be cleansed of the undesirables.

270
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,277
- There's always notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

271
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:25,973
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

272
00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:29,710
Jehuda, working hard?

273
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:33,707
This is the greatest pianist in
Poland. Maybe the whole world.

274
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,604
Wladyslaw Szpilman,
meet Majorek.

275
00:24:36,804 --> 00:24:38,602
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

276
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:43,158
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

277
00:24:43,838 --> 00:24:48,114
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

278
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:52,710
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

279
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,807
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

280
00:24:57,406 --> 00:24:58,925
Five hundred.

281
00:24:59,384 --> 00:25:02,542
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

282
00:25:02,742 --> 00:25:07,178
That makes 10 thousand readers.
This will start the uprising.

283
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:10,994
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

284
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:13,952
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

285
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:16,590
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

286
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,668
They're too clean for them.

287
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:27,100
Please, mister, please.

288
00:25:54,996 --> 00:25:58,313
Hold it!
You little bastard!

289
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:03,109
Take this!

290
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:06,726
Stop it! Stop it!

291
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:08,645
Stop it!

292
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:14,320
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.

293
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:23,911
Stand up! Stand up.

294
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:59,081
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

295
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:02,678
- Enjoy your meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

296
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:05,795
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon.

297
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:10,591
The Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

298
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:13,828
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

299
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:17,345
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so...

300
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:19,823
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

301
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:22,721
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

302
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,277
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja
and everybody else who was there.

303
00:27:30,054 --> 00:27:32,372
Isn't that a laugh?

304
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,868
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

305
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:38,747
I said nothing bad.

306
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:42,983
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

307
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:45,741
It's not funny.

308
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,258
You know what's funny? You're
funny, with that ridiculous tie.

309
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:53,454
What are you talking about? What's
my tie have to do with anything?

310
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,812
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

311
00:27:56,012 --> 00:28:00,088
- That's right, I work.
- Playing the piano for the parasites.

312
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:03,325
- Parasites...
- Boys. Boys!

313
00:28:04,025 --> 00:28:06,503
- They don't give a damn.
- And you blame me for their apathy?

314
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:10,060
I see it everyday. They don't even
notice what's going around them.

315
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,138
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

316
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:15,875
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

317
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:19,951
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying.

318
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:22,349
Haven't got a bite to eat.

319
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:28,164
The Jewish bankers should persuade
America to declare war on Germany.

320
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:47,427
The lights! The lights!

321
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:08,689
Turn on the lights.

322
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,844
Come on!

323
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:21,798
Open the door!
We want to go in!

324
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,934
Open the door!

325
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:42,160
Stand up!

326
00:29:44,738 --> 00:29:48,215
You, stand up! Come on!

327
00:29:49,314 --> 00:29:51,252
Throw him out!

328
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:05,999
Mama...

329
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:22,145
Come on, run!

330
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:34,403
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Go in. Not you.

331
00:31:53,926 --> 00:31:55,884
- What?
- Come. It's terrible.

332
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:59,082
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

333
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:01,440
They've taken Henryk.

334
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:05,876
Go home, alright? Go home,
I'll take care of it.

335
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:21,123
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

336
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:25,039
- I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

337
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:28,796
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

338
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:40,566
What happened here?

339
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:44,323
They've got my grandson. They
pick them up and take them away.

340
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:48,579
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

341
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,136
Excuse me. Excuse me.

342
00:32:53,714 --> 00:32:55,433
Itzak?

343
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:57,471
Itzak?

344
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:01,028
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

345
00:33:07,562 --> 00:33:09,960
- Henryk is in there.
- I haven't seen him.

346
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,238
Believe me.
They picked him up.

347
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:20,231
- Can you help?
- Now you need me. Now you need me!

348
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,549
Can you help us?

349
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:25,827
- It costs.
- I have no money.

350
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:28,504
Then there's nothing I can do.
You should have joined us.

351
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:33,900
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

352
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,537
People I know. They said
you're an important man.

353
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:42,452
Itzak...

354
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:01,016
- Hands up.
- How are you?

355
00:34:01,216 --> 00:34:04,733
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

356
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:07,551
Dead! Dead!

357
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,828
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

358
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:14,525
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

359
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:17,882
Thank you.

360
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:22,358
Everything is alright!

361
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:24,596
He looks very happy.

362
00:34:24,756 --> 00:34:27,513
Everything is alright.

363
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:30,990
Everything is alright.

364
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:35,986
Hands up! Hands up!

365
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:37,784
It's alright.

366
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:41,581
Help! Help!

367
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:45,298
Let go! Help!

368
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:42,648
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Itzak Heller?

369
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:46,285
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

370
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:51,201
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?
- I asked him to help you.

371
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,458
What did you pay him?

372
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:59,694
With what could I pay him? Every
zloty I earn we spend on food.

373
00:35:59,893 --> 00:36:02,771
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

374
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:06,728
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

375
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:10,165
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

376
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:14,781
- You're mad. That's your trouble.
- That's also my business.

377
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:27,350
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

378
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:30,667
Hungry.

379
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:41,697
Employment certificate. What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

380
00:36:41,897 --> 00:36:44,655
You have to have an
employment certificate...

381
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:48,292
to work for the Germans
in the ghetto, otherwise...

382
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:51,249
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

383
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:54,606
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

384
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:58,523
and send us to labor camps,
in the East.

385
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:03,738
- They're closing the small ghetto.
- Oh, God!

386
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,993
Wladek? Wladek?

387
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:26,249
I thought you were on tour playing
in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

388
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:29,086
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

389
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:32,124
Have you heard the rumors? They're
going to resettle us in the East.

390
00:37:32,364 --> 00:37:36,320
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart. What's the trouble?

391
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,256
I've been trying to get the certificate
of employment for my father.

392
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:44,693
I managed to get one for me and my
family, but I need one for my father.

393
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:47,970
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

394
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,208
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

395
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:52,766
I'm not, but Majorek is.

396
00:37:55,304 --> 00:37:57,422
Can you help?
I have no money.

397
00:37:57,582 --> 00:38:00,859
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

398
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:03,337
Be at the Schultz workshop
tomorrow, four o'clock.

399
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:06,174
See what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

400
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:10,091
That's the historical imperative in
action! That's why I always say:

401
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,609
- "Look on the bright side!"
- Yes, I know.

402
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:28,835
- How's your back?
- Better.

403
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:30,953
Better?

404
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:33,031
Better not ask.

405
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,996
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

406
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:55,552
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

407
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:10,487
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

408
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,724
At least we are still together.

409
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,750
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

410
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,188
Move, move!

411
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:37,484
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

412
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,159
Wait.

413
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:44,877
Here.

414
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:48,114
Go over there. Hurry.

415
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:50,732
You.

416
00:40:51,092 --> 00:40:53,690
You. You.

417
00:40:55,908 --> 00:40:57,586
You.

418
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,563
You.

419
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:05,040
You.

420
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,249
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

421
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:20,526
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

422
00:41:20,766 --> 00:41:23,564
Where are you taking us?

423
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:50,241
I'm sorry, I did my best.

424
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:55,396
- I thought the certificates'd save us.
- Stop it, Wladek.

425
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:58,993
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

426
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:28,647
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

427
00:42:29,267 --> 00:42:32,544
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

428
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,576
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

429
00:42:42,256 --> 00:42:47,411
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

430
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,547
Why did I do it?

431
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:38,547
Don't you have a bottle of water?
He's dying.

432
00:43:38,747 --> 00:43:40,625
My child is dying of thirst.

433
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,624
- I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

434
00:43:43,243 --> 00:43:47,000
- Don't you have water? I beg you.
- Can you hear what I'm saying?

435
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,438
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

436
00:43:49,597 --> 00:43:51,876
Letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter.

437
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:54,114
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

438
00:43:54,273 --> 00:43:57,311
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

439
00:43:57,511 --> 00:44:00,228
At least we can die honorably, not
as a stain on the face of History.

440
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,906
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

441
00:44:03,605 --> 00:44:06,123
You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

442
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:10,160
- They're going to wipe us all out.
- What do you want me to do? Fight?

443
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,917
To fight, we need organization,
plans, guns.

444
00:44:13,037 --> 00:44:15,595
He's right. Do you think I'm going
to fight with my violin bowl?

445
00:44:16,294 --> 00:44:19,052
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

446
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:21,570
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

447
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,049
Sure.

448
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:27,485
Look at that cripple, the old people,
the children. They're going to work?

449
00:44:28,724 --> 00:44:32,281
Look at you. You're going to carry
logs on your back?

450
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:17,222
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

451
00:45:27,193 --> 00:45:31,469
I missed you.
I wanted to be with you!

452
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,840
I wanted to be with you!

453
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,498
Stupid. Stupid.

454
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:49,434
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

455
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:52,791
She's getting on my nerves.

456
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:01,344
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

457
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:07,199
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

458
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:10,156
The baby cried
just as the police came.

459
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:14,852
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

460
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:19,648
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

461
00:46:45,246 --> 00:46:47,484
What are you reading?

462
00:46:50,301 --> 00:46:54,977
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

463
00:46:55,097 --> 00:46:57,295
If you poison us, do we not die?

464
00:46:57,455 --> 00:47:00,452
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

465
00:47:07,766 --> 00:47:11,163
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

466
00:47:30,067 --> 00:47:33,544
Idiot. What does he think
he's gonna do with the money?

467
00:47:34,543 --> 00:47:37,181
Boy, come here.

468
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,659
Come here.

469
00:47:40,898 --> 00:47:42,856
- How much for a caramel?
- 20 zlotys.

470
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,373
For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

471
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:48,771
20 zlotys.

472
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:52,827
We've got 20 between us.

473
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:55,505
I've got 10, I think.

474
00:47:58,143 --> 00:48:00,780
5, 10, 20.

475
00:49:24,068 --> 00:49:26,786
- Halina?
- What?

476
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:32,361
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

477
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,717
I wish I knew you better.

478
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:41,313
Thank you.

479
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,658
Szpilman?

480
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,248
Papa? Papa?

481
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:15,884
Mama? Halina?

482
00:50:16,403 --> 00:50:18,921
Halina? Mama?

483
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,276
What do you think you're doing?
I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

484
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,951
Don't run!

485
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:34,468
Anna!

486
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:37,445
Anna!

487
00:50:57,767 --> 00:51:00,805
Off they go to the melting pot.

488
00:51:03,762 --> 00:51:08,278
- This stays.
- Give it to me!

489
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,832
What are you doing?
She's pregnant.

490
00:53:42,705 --> 00:53:44,583
Wladek?

491
00:54:03,217 --> 00:54:06,214
Why are you here, Wladek?

492
00:54:06,414 --> 00:54:09,012
It's like this, I...

493
00:54:10,611 --> 00:54:12,449
We...

494
00:54:14,647 --> 00:54:17,445
All of them, all of them.

495
00:54:17,605 --> 00:54:19,763
All of them.

496
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:24,639
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

497
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:27,836
It's not finished yet. We'll stay
here for a couple of days...

498
00:54:28,036 --> 00:54:29,994
until things die down.

499
00:54:30,154 --> 00:54:33,551
I've bribed the policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

500
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:39,226
Attention!
On the march!

501
00:54:49,817 --> 00:54:51,695
Onward!

502
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:57,510
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

503
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,587
Don't get overexcited.

504
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:21,929
It's gold.
Very good price.

505
00:55:41,152 --> 00:55:43,031
Someone you know?

506
00:55:43,151 --> 00:55:45,109
A beauty.
Who is she?

507
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:49,685
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband is an actor.

508
00:55:49,885 --> 00:55:52,243
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

509
00:55:52,443 --> 00:55:56,159
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

510
00:56:21,857 --> 00:56:24,175
Turn left!

511
00:56:24,295 --> 00:56:26,693
On the march!

512
00:56:32,728 --> 00:56:35,406
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

513
00:56:42,439 --> 00:56:45,237
At ease.

514
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:52,291
Turn right!

515
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:01,803
Step forward.

516
00:57:03,072 --> 00:57:04,550
You.

517
00:57:06,748 --> 00:57:09,186
You. You.

518
00:57:09,866 --> 00:57:11,664
You.

519
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:17,419
Down on the ground!

520
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:20,616
Down on the ground!

521
00:57:48,293 --> 00:57:50,331
Turn left!

522
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:54,767
On the march.

523
00:58:34,632 --> 00:58:36,831
How long have you been here?

524
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:39,788
Since last night.

525
00:58:39,988 --> 00:58:42,306
I was pleased to see you.

526
00:58:46,063 --> 00:58:49,300
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

527
00:58:51,518 --> 00:58:53,796
We know what it means.

528
00:58:54,795 --> 00:58:58,592
We sent someone out.
Zygmund, a good man.

529
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,307
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

530
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,744
He got to Sokolow.

531
00:59:07,904 --> 00:59:12,500
A man told him the tracks divided,
one branch's leading to Treblinka.

532
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:18,395
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

533
00:59:18,594 --> 00:59:22,391
branch off to Treblinka
and return empty.

534
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:25,469
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

535
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:30,085
The civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

536
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:36,659
They're exterminating us.

537
00:59:40,336 --> 00:59:42,853
It won't take them long.

538
00:59:44,672 --> 00:59:48,149
We are 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

539
00:59:48,908 --> 00:59:51,386
Mostly young people.

540
00:59:52,585 --> 00:59:55,503
And this time we're gonna fight.

541
00:59:57,221 --> 00:59:59,899
We're in good shape.

542
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:03,855
Organized.
We're prepared.

543
01:00:04,055 --> 01:00:06,813
If you need help, I...

544
01:00:25,437 --> 01:00:28,674
You! Come here!

545
01:00:30,632 --> 01:00:32,391
Shit!

546
01:00:40,843 --> 01:00:43,081
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

547
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,598
I don't know what I was thinking.

548
01:00:57,209 --> 01:01:01,446
Take this! Take this!

549
01:01:15,473 --> 01:01:18,231
Take him away.

550
01:01:33,977 --> 01:01:37,694
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

551
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:41,811
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

552
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,768
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

553
01:02:08,008 --> 01:02:09,687
Trouble.

554
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,324
Round up only the Jews!

555
01:02:12,564 --> 01:02:15,362
Round up!
Only the Jews.

556
01:02:15,601 --> 01:02:18,879
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

557
01:02:26,582 --> 01:02:29,459
I have good news for you.

558
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:34,375
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

559
01:02:34,535 --> 01:02:37,333
to resettle you.

560
01:02:39,171 --> 01:02:44,047
I promise you that now
and in the future...

561
01:02:44,247 --> 01:02:47,684
nothing else is planned.

562
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:56,216
For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

563
01:02:57,495 --> 01:03:00,692
To show you our goodwill...

564
01:03:00,812 --> 01:03:04,649
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

565
01:03:04,809 --> 01:03:07,766
to go in town daily...

566
01:03:08,166 --> 01:03:14,081
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

567
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:18,557
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

568
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:23,952
So, why should we do something
like this if we'd resettle you?

569
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:31,016
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

570
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:38,430
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Making money?

571
01:03:42,227 --> 01:03:43,346
Dismiss them.

572
01:04:00,011 --> 01:04:03,808
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

573
01:05:12,628 --> 01:05:13,747
Now!

574
01:05:51,755 --> 01:05:53,633
Majorek.

575
01:05:55,272 --> 01:05:58,109
I have a favor to ask.

576
01:05:58,749 --> 01:06:01,027
I want to get out of here.

577
01:06:03,624 --> 01:06:07,901
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll
survive on the other side that's hard.

578
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,299
I know.

579
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:14,815
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

580
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:18,372
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

581
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:21,889
A singer, her husband
is an actor.

582
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:27,284
I've filled their names down and
their address, if they're still there.

583
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:32,699
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. They're good people.

584
01:06:33,658 --> 01:06:36,456
Would you try to make contact?

585
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:43,510
You go to town everyday. Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here.

586
01:07:17,121 --> 01:07:19,679
Have you got any plaster?

587
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:32,428
What are you up to?

588
01:07:33,906 --> 01:07:36,384
What have you got there?

589
01:07:36,584 --> 01:07:40,381
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

590
01:07:40,581 --> 01:07:43,258
Three kilos of potato and bread.

591
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:45,496
Open it.

592
01:07:49,053 --> 01:07:53,889
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

593
01:07:55,707 --> 01:07:57,786
Open it.

594
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:28,219
Potatoes!

595
01:08:31,696 --> 01:08:34,574
You Jews are all alike.

596
01:08:34,814 --> 01:08:38,331
We reach you with a finger...

597
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:41,408
and you take the whole hand.

598
01:08:55,396 --> 01:08:59,592
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

599
01:09:24,031 --> 01:09:26,229
I've tried your friends.

600
01:09:26,389 --> 01:09:29,666
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

601
01:09:30,186 --> 01:09:32,224
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

602
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:34,302
- Soon.
- Halt!

603
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:37,739
Shit! Shit!

604
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:40,457
Wait. What's going on here?

605
01:09:40,657 --> 01:09:44,174
Take this! Take this!

606
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:55,044
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

607
01:09:59,201 --> 01:10:01,519
Do you know why
you're being hit?

608
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,716
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

609
01:10:04,876 --> 01:10:09,272
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.

610
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:14,128
On the march!

611
01:10:15,447 --> 01:10:17,805
March and sing!

612
01:10:18,244 --> 01:10:19,883
Sing something nice!

613
01:10:21,102 --> 01:10:23,939
Loud and clear!

614
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:28,575
Reunite tonight
And follow the white eagle

615
01:10:29,564 --> 01:10:33,321
Stand up and fight
Our mortal enemies

616
01:10:33,481 --> 01:10:37,198
Rise on the day
Let's give them fire and brimstone

617
01:10:37,618 --> 01:10:41,494
We'll do away
The Yoke of slavery

618
01:10:41,544 --> 01:10:44,591
Punish and rout
The rapists of our nation

619
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,898
We'll slash them out
To save our dignity

620
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:24,707
Come.

621
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:40,721
I'm sorry.

622
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,058
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

623
01:13:09,077 --> 01:13:11,914
We haven't much time.
Come on.

624
01:13:19,268 --> 01:13:21,066
We must hurry.

625
01:13:21,226 --> 01:13:23,464
Here. See if these fit.

626
01:13:23,664 --> 01:13:27,621
We have to keep moving you. Germans
are hunting down indiscriminately.

627
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:31,437
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

628
01:13:31,637 --> 01:13:35,394
You better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

629
01:13:50,411 --> 01:13:53,248
You'll be looked after
by Gebczynski.

630
01:13:53,448 --> 01:13:55,446
He's on the other side of town.

631
01:13:55,526 --> 01:13:59,283
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

632
01:14:00,073 --> 01:14:04,309
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

633
01:14:43,995 --> 01:14:46,792
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

634
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:20,263
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

635
01:15:20,463 --> 01:15:25,179
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

636
01:15:32,523 --> 01:15:34,921
It's not going to be very comfortable.

637
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,318
I'll be fine.

638
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:49,448
Thank you.

639
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:07,792
Here. Here. Give it to me.

640
01:16:08,432 --> 01:16:12,228
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

641
01:16:30,772 --> 01:16:32,491
DO NOT PASS

642
01:17:04,043 --> 01:17:06,441
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

643
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:15,314
But you leave them open
during the day. Don't forget.

644
01:17:18,151 --> 01:17:21,388
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, eh?

645
01:17:21,978 --> 01:17:23,417
Yes.

646
01:17:24,865 --> 01:17:29,262
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

647
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,577
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

648
01:17:34,777 --> 01:17:38,054
I'll come again.
Janina will visit you twice a week.

649
01:17:38,174 --> 01:17:40,612
To bring more food,
see how you are.

650
01:17:41,431 --> 01:17:43,509
Thank you.

651
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:49,075
This is very important.
In case of emergency...

652
01:17:49,234 --> 01:17:53,391
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

653
01:18:36,114 --> 01:18:38,232
What do you mean you forgot?

654
01:18:38,432 --> 01:18:41,269
What do you think I mean?
I forgot, that's what I mean.

655
01:18:41,779 --> 01:18:47,134
- You know, you treat me like dirt.
- Because you are a dirt.

656
01:18:47,334 --> 01:18:49,692
- Pig! Pig!
- Bitch!

657
01:18:50,352 --> 01:18:53,069
- Dirty pig!
- You are a dirty pig!

658
01:18:53,269 --> 01:18:55,867
Takes one to know one. Pig.

659
01:18:59,783 --> 01:19:04,379
- You play like an angel.
- Then why don't you listen?

660
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:06,697
- I'm listening.
- Liar.

661
01:19:07,397 --> 01:19:10,594
You fell asleep. Pig.

662
01:19:32,615 --> 01:19:36,532
Spread out!
We're being attacked!

663
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:41,248
Take cover!

664
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:43,845
Shoot!

665
01:19:56,105 --> 01:19:58,862
Take cover! Fire!

666
01:20:03,109 --> 01:20:05,826
Come on, get out!

667
01:21:30,923 --> 01:21:33,161
The attack was successful.

668
01:21:35,079 --> 01:21:37,237
That building...

669
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:47,628
Turn that way!

670
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:57,939
Shoot!

671
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:24,037
Thank you.

672
01:22:27,574 --> 01:22:30,651
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, thank you.

673
01:22:34,818 --> 01:22:38,494
No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

674
01:22:39,114 --> 01:22:41,592
I never should've come out. I should
have stayed and fought with them.

675
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:45,109
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

676
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:48,026
Just be proud of them.

677
01:22:49,075 --> 01:22:52,512
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

678
01:22:54,281 --> 01:22:57,038
- So did the Germans.
- They are in shock!

679
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:02,713
They didn't expect it. Nobody
expected it. Jews fighting back.

680
01:23:02,913 --> 01:23:07,549
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

681
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:09,667
What good?

682
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:12,485
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

683
01:23:12,605 --> 01:23:17,281
They died with dignity.
And you know something else?

684
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:22,656
Now the Poles will rise.
We are ready.

685
01:23:22,856 --> 01:23:26,093
We'll fight too.
You'll see.

686
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:43,568
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

687
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:46,286
What? What's happened?

688
01:23:48,814 --> 01:23:50,852
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

689
01:23:51,052 --> 01:23:54,808
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

690
01:23:55,858 --> 01:23:59,574
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

691
01:24:00,064 --> 01:24:02,382
Where do you want me to go?

692
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:05,939
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

693
01:24:07,148 --> 01:24:10,425
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

694
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:13,262
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window...

695
01:24:13,462 --> 01:24:15,261
don't let them get you alive.

696
01:24:15,421 --> 01:24:18,538
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

697
01:27:35,108 --> 01:27:37,346
Open up!

698
01:27:39,904 --> 01:27:44,060
Open the door
or we'll call the police!

699
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:15,953
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

700
01:28:16,153 --> 01:28:19,270
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just
came to visit, but I missed him.

701
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:21,788
Have you got your identity card?

702
01:28:22,927 --> 01:28:25,764
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

703
01:28:28,822 --> 01:28:31,219
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

704
01:28:31,419 --> 01:28:33,977
He's a Jew! A Jew!

705
01:28:34,177 --> 01:28:35,935
Stop the Jew!

706
01:28:37,434 --> 01:28:40,032
Don't let him out!
Stop him!

707
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:57,075
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

708
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:07,366
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

709
01:30:08,565 --> 01:30:10,524
Come in.

710
01:30:17,548 --> 01:30:19,106
I'm sorry.

711
01:30:19,306 --> 01:30:22,663
I was given this address and
I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

712
01:30:23,263 --> 01:30:26,780
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

713
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:29,018
Come in.

714
01:30:37,011 --> 01:30:38,969
Sit.

715
01:30:41,807 --> 01:30:44,045
I need help.

716
01:30:46,203 --> 01:30:49,000
He'll be back before curfew.

717
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,638
I've been in hiding.

718
01:30:52,797 --> 01:30:56,154
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

719
01:30:58,482 --> 01:31:01,520
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

720
01:31:04,487 --> 01:31:07,005
And how is Jurek?

721
01:31:07,165 --> 01:31:08,803
Dead.

722
01:31:15,737 --> 01:31:19,374
- When is your baby due?
- Christmas.

723
01:31:20,014 --> 01:31:23,690
This is not a good time to
have children, but then...

724
01:31:26,098 --> 01:31:29,375
This is my husband.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.

725
01:31:29,575 --> 01:31:34,211
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Yes, I remember.

726
01:31:36,469 --> 01:31:39,067
He said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

727
01:31:39,267 --> 01:31:41,105
Don't worry now.

728
01:31:50,407 --> 01:31:54,484
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

729
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,718
Excuse me.

730
01:32:05,015 --> 01:32:07,892
I'm sorry,
could I have a piece of bread?

731
01:32:08,092 --> 01:32:10,730
Yes, of course.
We will eat.

732
01:32:11,619 --> 01:32:15,136
Sit. Please, sit.

733
01:32:15,336 --> 01:32:17,014
Thank you.

734
01:34:25,323 --> 01:34:28,281
You're on a very German area.

735
01:34:28,481 --> 01:34:32,717
On the opposite is a hospital taking
wounded from the Russian front.

736
01:34:34,725 --> 01:34:37,962
And next door is the
Schutzpolizei.

737
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:41,669
Safest place to be.

738
01:34:41,869 --> 01:34:44,667
Right at the heart
of the lion's den.

739
01:34:50,082 --> 01:34:52,200
I'll be locking you in.

740
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:56,197
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

741
01:37:06,364 --> 01:37:08,243
All well?

742
01:37:08,762 --> 01:37:09,761
Thank you.

743
01:37:15,037 --> 01:37:18,714
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

744
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,632
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

745
01:37:20,792 --> 01:37:22,510
Thank you.

746
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,756
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring food, see that you're alright.

747
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:30,753
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

748
01:37:35,209 --> 01:37:39,206
- You don't remember me?
- I don't think so.

749
01:37:39,406 --> 01:37:42,803
Warsaw Radio.
I was a technician.

750
01:37:43,612 --> 01:37:46,649
I saw you almost everyday.

751
01:37:47,419 --> 01:37:50,736
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- It doesn't matter.

752
01:37:52,934 --> 01:37:56,491
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

753
01:37:57,550 --> 01:38:00,268
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

754
01:38:00,387 --> 01:38:02,386
night after night, after night.

755
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:05,483
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

756
01:38:05,973 --> 01:38:09,090
And the Russians are giving them
hell. It's the beginning of the end.

757
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:10,848
Let's hope so.

758
01:38:21,739 --> 01:38:23,857
Come here.

759
01:38:24,017 --> 01:38:26,135
Be careful with it.

760
01:38:27,054 --> 01:38:29,892
That's it. Be careful.

761
01:38:57,009 --> 01:38:59,726
Still alive then?

762
01:39:02,963 --> 01:39:06,909
Here. Sausage, bread.

763
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:09,028
You still got that vodka?

764
01:39:23,775 --> 01:39:27,572
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

765
01:39:28,551 --> 01:39:31,589
I think I've got jaundice.

766
01:39:31,828 --> 01:39:35,505
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

767
01:39:37,004 --> 01:39:40,921
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

768
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:42,919
Drink up.

769
01:39:43,758 --> 01:39:46,636
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks...

770
01:39:46,835 --> 01:39:48,594
Problems.

771
01:39:48,904 --> 01:39:50,942
Money.

772
01:39:51,691 --> 01:39:54,169
I've got to raise money
to buy the food.

773
01:39:54,669 --> 01:39:58,385
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

774
01:40:02,142 --> 01:40:04,700
Here. Sell this.

775
01:40:06,938 --> 01:40:09,056
Food is more important than time.

776
01:40:14,552 --> 01:40:17,549
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

777
01:40:17,749 --> 01:40:19,947
Russians will be here soon.

778
01:40:20,386 --> 01:40:23,224
They'll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

779
01:40:24,063 --> 01:40:26,022
any day now.

780
01:41:10,303 --> 01:41:12,222
Wladek?

781
01:41:21,733 --> 01:41:24,691
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

782
01:41:26,849 --> 01:41:29,087
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

783
01:41:29,247 --> 01:41:32,804
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

784
01:41:33,523 --> 01:41:35,881
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

785
01:41:36,081 --> 01:41:39,158
You stay. I'll go.

786
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:15,047
We came to say goodbye.

787
01:42:15,207 --> 01:42:18,125
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

788
01:42:18,574 --> 01:42:21,732
The baby is already there.
It's safer.

789
01:42:21,931 --> 01:42:25,888
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

790
01:42:27,487 --> 01:42:30,364
That man Szalas should be shot.

791
01:42:31,173 --> 01:42:35,170
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

792
01:42:36,179 --> 01:42:41,015
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

793
01:42:45,381 --> 01:42:48,139
My God.

794
01:42:51,376 --> 01:42:56,492
The liver the size of a football.
Inflammation of the gall bladder...

795
01:42:57,081 --> 01:42:59,439
but he'll live.

796
01:43:01,997 --> 01:43:06,033
I'll try to get him some laevulose,
but it's not easy.

797
01:43:06,233 --> 01:43:09,750
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

798
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:14,106
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

799
01:43:17,543 --> 01:43:19,981
Thank you so much for coming.

800
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:24,198
We've brought you some food.

801
01:43:24,687 --> 01:43:28,364
I'll prepare something now
for you, then we must go.

802
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:10,448
I'll throw a grenade!

803
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:22,797
There's a wounded man over there!

804
01:44:23,277 --> 01:44:25,674
Come.

805
01:44:25,834 --> 01:44:28,152
Watch out! Watch out!

806
01:44:30,191 --> 01:44:33,028
- I'll go get help!
- Hurry!

807
01:44:34,667 --> 01:44:38,543
Come on! Bring the litter!

808
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:44,698
Go back inside!

809
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:31,805
Get out, get out in the streets!

810
01:46:36,002 --> 01:46:39,599
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

811
01:47:20,963 --> 01:47:25,119
Somebody...
Somebody help me!

812
01:48:22,550 --> 01:48:25,587
Are you alright?
There's too much dust.

813
01:48:25,987 --> 01:48:30,343
I'll check this side.
Don't worry.

814
01:48:30,793 --> 01:48:33,151
Be careful! In the attic.

815
01:48:38,886 --> 01:48:41,443
- Heinrich?
- I'm checking!

816
01:48:43,881 --> 01:48:46,279
Is there anybody here?

817
01:48:50,695 --> 01:48:54,692
- Come on down!
- Alright, I'm coming.

818
01:53:02,518 --> 01:53:04,236
Come on, pile them up.

819
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:13,129
Throw it.

820
01:54:36,856 --> 01:54:39,694
We have to mark everything.

821
01:54:41,632 --> 01:54:42,631
Come on.

822
02:01:43,148 --> 02:01:45,426
What are you doing here?

823
02:01:50,202 --> 02:01:52,440
Who are you?

824
02:01:56,456 --> 02:01:59,893
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

825
02:02:02,331 --> 02:02:04,489
What are you doing?

826
02:02:09,345 --> 02:02:11,263
I was...

827
02:02:11,343 --> 02:02:14,341
trying to open this can.

828
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:17,938
Do you live here?

829
02:02:21,295 --> 02:02:23,173
Do you work here?

830
02:02:23,333 --> 02:02:24,972
No.

831
02:02:28,828 --> 02:02:31,226
What do you do for a living?

832
02:02:34,204 --> 02:02:35,962
I am...

833
02:02:37,481 --> 02:02:40,398
I was a pianist.

834
02:02:42,606 --> 02:02:44,764
Pianist?

835
02:03:03,748 --> 02:03:05,666
Come.

836
02:03:30,655 --> 02:03:32,213
Play something.

837
02:08:52,017 --> 02:08:54,735
Are you hiding here?

838
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:01,239
Jew?

839
02:09:04,077 --> 02:09:06,395
Where are you hiding yourself?

840
02:09:07,993 --> 02:09:09,911
In the attic.

841
02:09:13,488 --> 02:09:15,766
Show it to me.

842
02:09:38,976 --> 02:09:41,174
Have you got anything to eat?

843
02:10:28,573 --> 02:10:33,929
According to them,
it's very important that...

844
02:10:40,153 --> 02:10:41,872
Attention!

845
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:46,578
- Good Morning Gentlemen.
- At ease.

846
02:11:51,931 --> 02:11:53,850
Jew?

847
02:12:08,677 --> 02:12:10,076
Please.

848
02:12:10,326 --> 02:12:12,284
What does it mean,
all that shooting?

849
02:12:12,763 --> 02:12:15,441
The Russians,
on the other side of the river.

850
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:20,037
You just have to hold on
a couple of weeks, not more.

851
02:13:51,718 --> 02:13:54,436
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

852
02:13:57,233 --> 02:14:00,390
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

853
02:14:03,438 --> 02:14:07,155
I don't know how to thank you.

854
02:14:08,903 --> 02:14:11,021
Thank God, not me.

855
02:14:11,711 --> 02:14:17,106
He wants us to survive. At least,
we have to believe in that.

856
02:14:26,897 --> 02:14:30,135
Here. Take it.

857
02:14:31,294 --> 02:14:35,450
- And you?
- I have another one. A warmer one.

858
02:14:39,986 --> 02:14:42,714
What are you going to do
when this is over?

859
02:14:45,441 --> 02:14:50,037
I'll play piano again at
the Polish radio station.

860
02:14:50,537 --> 02:14:52,296
Tell me your name.

861
02:14:52,645 --> 02:14:54,314
I'll keep my ears open.

862
02:14:55,173 --> 02:15:00,249
Szpilman.
- Szpilman, hm...

863
02:15:01,747 --> 02:15:04,545
A Good name for a pianist.

864
02:16:26,954 --> 02:16:29,511
German! German!

865
02:16:52,891 --> 02:16:55,449
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

866
02:16:56,708 --> 02:16:58,666
I'm Polish!

867
02:16:59,386 --> 02:17:01,983
- Come out with your hands up!
- Please! I beg of you!

868
02:17:02,663 --> 02:17:07,139
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish.

869
02:17:07,339 --> 02:17:09,297
Come down!

870
02:17:12,994 --> 02:17:16,950
Please, I'm Polish.
Please.

871
02:17:17,350 --> 02:17:19,428
He's Polish.

872
02:17:22,646 --> 02:17:24,844
Yes, he's Polish.

873
02:17:26,043 --> 02:17:28,401
Why the fucking coat?

874
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:31,598
I'm cold.

875
02:17:50,781 --> 02:17:53,699
Look at them.
German fuckers!

876
02:17:54,518 --> 02:17:57,396
Murderers! Murderers!

877
02:17:57,735 --> 02:18:01,052
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

878
02:18:01,212 --> 02:18:04,569
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

879
02:18:04,689 --> 02:18:08,526
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

880
02:18:08,686 --> 02:18:11,963
You took my violin,
you took my soul.

881
02:18:16,939 --> 02:18:18,537
Musician?

882
02:18:20,296 --> 02:18:22,174
Are you a musician?

883
02:18:23,093 --> 02:18:25,211
Do you know...

884
02:18:25,491 --> 02:18:28,529
a pianist called Szpilman,
from the Polish radio station?

885
02:18:28,728 --> 02:18:33,764
- Of course I know him.
- I helped him to hide himself.

886
02:18:34,873 --> 02:18:36,911
Tell him I'm here.

887
02:18:37,671 --> 02:18:39,749
Ask him to help me.

888
02:18:43,166 --> 02:18:45,844
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.

889
02:18:46,083 --> 02:18:47,242
What?

890
02:20:29,284 --> 02:20:31,762
It was here, I'm certain of it.

891
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:35,759
Well, it's not here now.

892
02:20:35,958 --> 02:20:39,915
I shouted abuse at them. I'm not
proud of it, but that's what I did.

893
02:20:40,804 --> 02:20:42,483
And I'm certain I stood where you are now.

894
02:20:42,962 --> 02:20:46,160
There was a barbed wire
and this German came up to me.

895
02:20:47,648 --> 02:20:51,165
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

896
02:20:53,843 --> 02:20:56,843
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
