00:00:23,537 --> 00:00:26,017
Wilhelm

3
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,095
Charlotte

4
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:38,295
"Most people think,
that war mainly consists of fighting."

5
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:41,454
"But that's not true.
It's waiting..."

6
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:44,254
"...for the next attack,
the next meal,

7
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:46,413
the next morning."

8
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:09,249
Erika.

9
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:25,686
Stop here.

10
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,243
Is he dead?
- No idea.

11
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:46,922
No.

12
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:50,841
Do you speak german?
Yes.

13
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:55,121
Are you german?
Yes.

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,240
Shit. Untether him.

15
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:03,799
<i>What now? How long do you want to wait?</i>

16
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:06,999
<i>Until we know on which side your friend is.</i>

17
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:16,757
Who was that?
Partisans.

18
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,315
We'll take you with us.
No.

19
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:28,075
We don't leave you behind...
We stay here. We three.

20
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:32,434
If you lay down your weapons,
maybe they'll let you live.

21
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:37,233
There are ten heavily armed
Partisans over there.

22
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:43,032
<i>He's warning them.</i>

23
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:45,991
<i>Shoot!</i>

24
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,111
Shit. It's an ambush.

25
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,030
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

26
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:56,389
<i>Shoot!</i>

27
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,188
<i>I said: Shoot!</i>

28
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,268
<i>It's jammed!</i>

29
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:09,587
<i>Shit, what are you doing...</i>

30
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,265
<i>What's going on?</i>

31
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:39,301
<i>Andrej, Marek... Move! Quick!</i>

32
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
<i>Once again, two of them less!</i>

33
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,060
<i>Be quiet! Better collect these rounds...</i>

34
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,260
<i>Watches, rings, golden teeth...</i>

35
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:54,779
<i>Not bad. Not bad, Kiddo!</i>

36
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:05,737
<i>Not bad! I like you, Kiddo!</i>

37
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:13,815
<i>You really wanted to shoot, didn't you?</i>

38
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,632
Winter, get out!

39
00:04:57,487 --> 00:05:00,167
There are still a few...

40
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:03,366
...who think they can just

41
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:07,926
chicken out of the lifestruggle
of the German Empire.

42
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:11,605
Your verdict was changed.

43
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,684
The Fuhrer has approved
a special parole for you.

44
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,843
And from now on...

45
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:22,283
...you belong to me,

46
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:25,842
<i>the Bewährungsbataillon 500.</i>

47
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:29,642
To weed out all the trash:

48
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:34,441
Defeatists, Communists,
Deserteurs...

49
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,400
I guess the Fuhrer needs
every man for the final victory?

50
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:47,838
We're not wasting bullets on
scumbags like you.

51
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:52,877
You still are going to die.
Just a little slower.

52
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:56,917
And before you die you can do
something for your german fatherland.

53
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,996
Stand up, we're leaving!

54
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:12,034
"Most people think,
War consists mostly of fighting."

55
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,313
"That's not true."

56
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:16,953
Mount up!

57
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:18,912
"It's waiting..."

58
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:27,431
"June 1944. I don't know if my
brother Friedhelm is still alive."

59
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,870
"And the others,
Greta, Viktor, Charly."

60
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,070
"150.000 Americans
have landed in the Normandy."

61
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:37,389
<i>"Rome has fallen. The Wehrmacht
has evacuated Tuscany."</i>

62
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,469
"Three years ago we took off,

63
00:06:39,628 --> 00:06:42,148
to save our people,
as we thought."

64
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:46,068
"But instead, we have brought
death, suffering and destruction upon millions."

65
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:48,947
"Back then we were heroes,
today we are murderers."

66
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:03,985
<i>We need Butter, Flour, Milk, Eggs.</i>

67
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,064
<i>Something else?</i>

68
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:07,884
<i>Pigs. -
Pigs. At least three a month.</i>

69
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:11,023
<i>And geese? For christmas?</i>

70
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:13,222
<i>The germans just go and take them...</i>

71
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:14,862
<i>We pay.</i>

72
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,981
<i>After each of your activities,</i>

73
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:22,021
<i>the germans take hostages.</i>

74
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,500
<i>And when the Russians come,
it won't get better.</i>

75
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:32,739
<i>Show me your arm.</i>

76
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:34,617
<i>Come on, show me!</i>

77
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,697
<i>Just raise it like that!</i>

78
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:41,177
<i>Is that better?
Do you want it to be like this?</i>

79
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:42,817
<i>The Russians are coming.
No matter what happens.</i>

80
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:44,537
<i>Stalin will defeat Hitler.</i>

81
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,656
<i>He has defeated him at Stalingrad
and Kursk</i>

82
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,416
<i>The Germans think of us as slaves.
But the russians do so as well.</i>

83
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:52,815
<i>Are we really? Slaves?</i>

84
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,255
<i>Are there any jews among you?</i>

85
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:56,934
<i>Jews?</i>

86
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:02,373
<i>Are here any?</i>

87
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:04,813
<i>Are there any Jews present?</i>

88
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,212
<i>No, no Jews. I can smell Jews.</i>

89
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:15,971
<i>Three bags of flour...</i>

90
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:19,769
<i>...fifty Eggs and four Chickens.
- Ten.</i>

91
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,170
<i>Eight.</i>

92
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,290
<i>All right. Eight.</i>

93
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:24,809
<i>And no Jews.</i>

94
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,289
<i>We drown Jews like cats.</i>

95
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:57,924
You're with Erika in cell 17.
What's your name?

96
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:01,922
Greta.

97
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:06,882
Is it true that you used to be a singer?

98
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:11,401
The women say,
you were Greta DelTorres.

99
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:38,196
<i>Winter. Ever driven a
PKW Typ 40?</i>

100
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:42,036
<i>Good. Tomorrow Standartenführer
Hiemer is arriving here.</i>

101
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,755
He's leading the mission
against the polish partisans.

102
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:46,794
He needs a driver, who is familiar with the
surroundings.

103
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,674
Can you take care of that?
- Yes.

104
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,834
Good.

105
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:30,147
You there! Come with me!

106
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,265
You see that hut?

107
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:44,264
It's in the artilleries line
of fire. Burn it.

108
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,583
<i>Jawohl.</i>

109
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,262
That's idiotic.

110
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:56,062
What was that?

111
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,780
The fire will alert the Russians.

112
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:11,139
You are going to burn that
Bolshevik-Hut there now.

113
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:18,618
Three years ago they welcomed us
as liberators.

114
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,977
Burn it!

115
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,416
If god doesn't grand us victory,
we're all going to pay.

116
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:32,415
Whatever god's intention is,
it most certainly isn't victory.

117
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:24,965
Tschai?

118
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:29,285
<i>Please sit down.</i>

119
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,600
Good morning.
- Good morning.

120
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:05,998
You're lucky. It's healing well.

121
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:08,758
In three or four days
you can be discharged.

122
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:12,397
How many days of
convalescent leave do I get?

123
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:19,676
What's going on? Does that mean
vacations are banned?

124
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:24,715
Treatment as before.

125
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:33,953
Nurse?

126
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:47,431
Weird.
I can't smell anything burnt.

127
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,590
That's insubordination!
And you know, what's the penalty for that.

128
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,349
<i>Herr Oberfeldwebel!</i>

129
00:13:58,388 --> 00:14:00,828
<i>Herr Oberfeldwebel! Staff is calling!</i>

130
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:03,348
What!?
- We're not allowed to lay fires.

131
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:08,147
Otherwise the russians will know
we're retreating.

132
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:15,145
Attention!

133
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:49,059
<i>Do you have something for me?</i>

134
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:50,779
<i>Hiemer.</i>

135
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:56,978
<i>He lead the fights against
the jews and partisans.</i>

136
00:14:57,177 --> 00:14:59,017
<i>In the Ukraine and Belarus.</i>

137
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:01,497
<i>Thorough and cruel.</i>

138
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,016
<i>He is going to come here because of us.</i>

139
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:14,695
<i>Prepare everything. We're going to attack tomorrow.</i>

140
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:28,532
Stalin will be victorious.

141
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,771
Try to sleep.

142
00:15:58,366 --> 00:15:59,846
Hans!

143
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:03,526
Nurse Char...
Psst...!

144
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:09,804
What...?
Do you want to go back to the frontlines?

145
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,844
But the doctor said...

146
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:17,003
Bite this!
Don't make a sound!

147
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:22,442
Psst...!

148
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,762
We should...?

149
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:28,801
What are you doing there?

150
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,561
Nothing! Go away!

151
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,759
That'll get you two weeks.

152
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,918
<i>Then convalescent leave at the
military hospital in Berchtesgaden.</i>

153
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:24,711
Go.

154
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:58,025
<i>What's going on here Gefreiter?</i>

155
00:17:58,184 --> 00:18:00,424
Partisans have destroyed
the bridge right ahead.

156
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:04,624
<i>The Standartenführer has to turn left
here and after 3km right again and then
continue the regular route.</i>

157
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:30,299
What is that supposed to be?

158
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:35,127
How did you know that there
was an ambush?

159
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:38,687
Instinct.
- Instinct, yeah?

160
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,045
I guess, you're experienced after all.

161
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:48,684
Yes.

162
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:58,083
I instantly recognized you.
I never forget a face.

163
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:02,522
I've even got your file sent for me.

164
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:06,041
You have a brother.

165
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:10,881
Wilhelm.
- He is dead.

166
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:19,119
Desertion.

167
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,438
He isn't dead.

168
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,478
He was pardoned.

169
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:28,717
<i>Bewährungsbataillon 500.</i>

170
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:41,875
Shall we drive?

171
00:21:25,307 --> 00:21:26,867
I just...

172
00:21:27,026 --> 00:21:29,026
Please. Sit down.

173
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:37,705
Your name is Sonja.
Yes.

174
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:41,904
What are you reading?

175
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:46,543
<i>"The enlightenment of a hunter."</i>

176
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:48,902
What is it about?

177
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:52,582
It's about the poor under Tsar Nicholas.

178
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:57,741
They are slaves. The lords do with them
whatever they want.

179
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,301
Buy, sell.

180
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,540
Wassja is a farmers boy.
His lord beating him.

181
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,619
We treat our own people so bad.

182
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,099
We germans can do that as well.

183
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:15,738
I once knew someone. She was...

184
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:18,177
Hey, you there! Empty the bedpans!

185
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:26,416
What's going on with you?

186
00:22:27,855 --> 00:22:30,055
Do you really think I don't
see what you're doing?

187
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,655
The private on the A,
and the others?

188
00:22:32,814 --> 00:22:34,854
Are you mad?

189
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:39,054
That's undermining of military morale.
I'm supposed to report you.

190
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:44,373
Do you think the Russians will spare you,
if they win?

191
00:22:45,252 --> 00:22:48,492
<i>I thought, you were firmly
believing in the final victory.</i>

192
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:50,211
What else?

193
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:54,051
The Russians are breaking through everywhere.
Minsk already has fallen.

194
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,410
It's just 500 km to warsaw.

195
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,490
When we lose the war,
do you know what they're doing to us?

196
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:03,049
Huh?

197
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:38,203
Get down! Down!

198
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:42,722
Damn it,
don't shoot unless ordered to!

199
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,801
Way too nervous.

200
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:50,201
Oh, ho. Rabbit hunt.

201
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,640
There you go. Your rabbit.

202
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,579
On Three.

203
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,539
One...

204
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,679
two...

205
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:04,798
Woman screams

206
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:14,036
Bring them to the city!

207
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,869
Each and every cowardly attack

208
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,748
<i>on soldiers of the german Wehrmacht</i>

209
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:01,908
by criminal and malicious gangs

210
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,547
will also in the future

211
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:07,906
be met with relentless retaliation.

212
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:12,426
As a warning for everyone,
who is involved or is planning to be.

213
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:14,985
Understood?

214
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:21,864
Give me that.

215
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:23,743
Friedhelm. Come on!

216
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,182
On my command.

217
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:37,541
And... now!

218
00:25:57,977 --> 00:25:59,937
<i>They were our friends!</i>

219
00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:01,776
<i>You're right.</i>

220
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:04,976
<i>But now?
What kind of alternative do you have?</i>

221
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:07,005
Agnieszka had two little children.

222
00:26:07,535 --> 00:26:10,255
<i>So, Stanisu, do you have any idea?
I'm asking you a question!</i>

223
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:12,894
<i>Do you want to lay down your arms?</i>

224
00:26:13,014 --> 00:26:15,134
<i>But because of us Poles are dying!
- Because of us?</i>

225
00:26:15,494 --> 00:26:16,534
<i>How because of us?</i>

226
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:18,853
<i>Do you personally put a noose
around their necks?</i>

227
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:22,613
<i>Does Krystyna slit their throats?
Krystyna, do you slit their throats?</i>

228
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:25,052
<i>One of them was Agnieszka.
We knew them all!</i>

229
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:27,552
<i>If they want to kill us,
it means we have to kill them.</i>

230
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:29,251
<i>Until Poland is free again.</i>

231
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,211
<i>Shut up!
- Quiet!</i>

232
00:26:31,411 --> 00:26:33,811
<i>Stop it! Not a single word now!</i>

233
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:42,409
It's not about dying,
it's about how we die.

234
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:49,328
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

235
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:52,647
<i>And that from the german twat.</i>

236
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:55,247
<i>Good, Victor!</i>

237
00:26:57,966 --> 00:27:00,246
<i>We'll just manage with the Russians...</i>

238
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:02,725
<i>but if the Germans win the war,</i>

239
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:05,925
<i>we'll all be sentenced to death.</i>

240
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,360
What...?

241
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,039
A transfer?
You can go back to Germany with this.

242
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:44,558
I...

243
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:49,517
I'm supposed to turn my back on all of you here?
The war is almost over. Maybe only a few months...

244
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:54,436
You... you could wait for me there.

245
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:03,434
Hildegard wanted to report you.

246
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:06,154
You're sabotaging the
recovery of soldiers.

247
00:28:06,313 --> 00:28:08,193
That is undermining of military morale.

248
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:35,828
<i>Bewährungsbataillon.
Cowards and traitors.</i>

249
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:39,108
We should stay away from them.
Do I belong to them as well?

250
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:40,787
I warned you.

251
00:28:40,947 --> 00:28:42,707
You're denouncing me!?

252
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:46,827
I'm just doing my duty.
Like you did with Lilija.

253
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:52,865
Wilhelm.

254
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,105
You know one of those?

255
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:05,783
Charly!

256
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,262
No!

257
00:29:09,422 --> 00:29:12,702
I don't understand.
Friedhelm said you were...

258
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:14,341
I know.

259
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:16,501
Come here!

260
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,780
It's okay.

261
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:25,539
No! You have to be dead.

262
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:29,419
You have to be dead!

263
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:32,578
All this time I have...

264
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:37,977
I love you...

265
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:41,896
Charly!

266
00:29:42,056 --> 00:29:44,896
Don't worry nurse,
he's going to die soon.

267
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:46,855
Charly!

268
00:30:40,365 --> 00:30:41,965
Wilhelm!

269
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,555
Here, eat!

270
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:52,913
Eat it! Regardless of how disgusting it is.

271
00:31:53,552 --> 00:31:55,152
Just like Arthur here.

272
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:59,031
You were good.

273
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:11,149
Do you know, that I met my
husband because of you?

274
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:22,748
<i>I took the train to Bernau
with a couple of girls.</i>

275
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:25,386
<i>We hiked to the Liepnitzsee.</i>

276
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:28,346
In the evening there was a dance
at the beer garden.

277
00:32:28,505 --> 00:32:30,225
And they played your song there.

278
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:34,185
He kept looking at us

279
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:38,744
He was large, pretty good looking.

280
00:32:38,904 --> 00:32:42,304
and when he came to us,
I thought at first he meant Inge.

281
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:45,303
But he asked me.

282
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:51,342
He kept dragging his right leg,
the SA had smashed it.

283
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:55,101
But he danced well.

284
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,860
I knew it from this evening on,
that he was the one.

285
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:04,739
We married after two months.

286
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:16,537
And tomorrow morning,
they are going to pick me up.

287
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:27,335
"... you're my husband"

288
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:31,375
"My tiny heart"

289
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:35,334
"Doesn't stay still"

00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:39,253
"It keeps me awake the whole night"

291
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:43,533
"and just keeps beating..."

292

A gang of cowardly
traitors to the fatherland

301

has attempted an assasination
of the Fuhrer.

302
00:35:12,116 --> 00:35:14,996
But there is a vision
for germany.

303
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,155
Which is called: Adolf Hitler.

304

The Fuhrer lives.

305
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:25,914
Is there anyone here,
who is extraordinarily dissappointed!?

With him, we'll never give up.

307

We'll fight for every city,
and for every house until the end.

We've got to hurry up then.

It was the jews back home,

this won't happen to us.

00:36:45,499 --> 00:36:48,899
"The Russians are not subhumans,
as they told us."

324
00:36:49,058 --> 00:36:52,278
"They guarantee an honorable treatment."

325
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:56,417
"Three meals and being able to return to your
home to children and wifes right after the war." No way.

326
00:36:58,936 --> 00:37:04,136
(Music: Giuseppe Verdi -
"Chorus of the slaves")

327
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:19,853
Good luck.

328
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:49,007
Good!

329
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:54,966
It's possible that the military hospital
is going to be moved again.

330
00:37:55,126 --> 00:37:58,326
What are you going to do then?
Come with us?

331
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,605
Then they will...

332
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:06,964
...as a traitor.

333
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,640
<i>I couldn't get closer.</i>

334
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,920
<i>Most of them are women. Jews.</i>

335
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,840
<i>They produce Ammunition packaging
for the Wehrmacht and mend uniforms.</i>

336
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:36,039
<i>This is our target. The weapons depot.</i>

337
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:39,477
<i>There are four watch towers with searchlights.</i>

338
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,558
<i>That fence is live. Very deadly.</i>

339
00:38:42,577 --> 00:38:46,337
Sometimes prisoners to run into it
if can't handle it anymore.

340
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,236
<i>The guards are ukranian SS.</i>

341
00:39:01,314 --> 00:39:03,354
<i>We can't go in at the front.</i>

342
00:39:07,873 --> 00:39:09,393
<i>What's that?</i>

343
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:11,592
<i>The train supplies them with
food and weapons.</i>

344
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:16,432
<i>When it's empty, it transports the
Ammo Packaging and the uniforms for the Wehrmacht.</i>

345
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:22,109
<i>We're attacking on open ground.</i>

346
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:25,029
<i>You find out when the next
transport is due.</i>

347
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:28,869
<i>Do you understand?</i>

348
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:32,948
We attack train.

349
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:12,901
Take care of Arthur.

350
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:15,848
<i>You can take pork...</i>

351
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:17,248
<i>...or beef...</i>

352
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,089
<i>...or deer...</i>

353
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:21,169
<i>That's so good.</i>

354
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:25,487
<i>No, the most important is the sausage.</i>

355
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:28,287
<i>With garlic.</i>

356
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,845
<i>and Sauerkraut.</i>

357
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:37,446
<i>Mushrooms and Sauerkraut.</i>

358
00:41:37,805 --> 00:41:39,925
<i>It doesn't matter what you put in a 'Bigos'.</i>

359
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:42,705
<i>You have to let it sit
for at least one night.</i>

360
00:41:42,724 --> 00:41:44,284
<i>My grandmather kept saying:</i>

361
00:41:44,844 --> 00:41:46,924
<i>"A good 'Bigos' is like a good marriage.</i>

362
00:41:47,124 --> 00:41:49,284
<i>The longer it takes,
the longer it tastes."</i>

363
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,203
What you saying?

364
00:41:54,082 --> 00:41:57,002
<i>Since when does a German know
what 'Bigos' is?</i>

365
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,122
<i>Soundy like a Goulashe.</i>

366
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:01,761
<i>Goulashe?</i>

367
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:03,161
<i>Bigos is no Goulashe.</i>

368
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:04,801
<i>Bigos is Poland.</i>

369
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,240
<i>You said the train will be here at nine.</i>

370
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,639
<i>Yes. So?
Am I responsible for the Germans?</i>

371
00:42:15,278 --> 00:42:17,078
<i>Maybe they already capitulated.</i>

372
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:41,634
<i>And what if he ignores the stop signal
and keeps driving?</i>

373
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:43,793
<i>He won't do that.</i>

374
00:42:44,593 --> 00:42:47,193
A german officer doesn't
ignore a german sign.

375
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,067
<i>Not yet...</i>

376
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:22,866
<i>Now.</i>

377
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:25,266
<i>Now!</i>

378
00:43:39,343 --> 00:43:41,023
Stop!

379
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,340
<i>I think we killed them all.</i>

380
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,140
<i>The first group comes with me.</i>

381
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:24,775
Stop!

382
00:44:27,494 --> 00:44:28,694
<i>Where the hell did that come from?</i>

383
00:44:28,853 --> 00:44:30,213
<i>There's one left!</i>

384
00:44:32,893 --> 00:44:34,133
<i>Did we get him?</i>

385
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:05,888
On Three? One...

386
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:08,807
...two, three.

387
00:45:32,202 --> 00:45:32,962
<i>Go!</i>

388
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,840
<i>What are we doing with them?</i>

389
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,280
<i>What do you mean?</i>

390
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,599
<i>Most of them are Jews.</i>

391
00:45:55,918 --> 00:45:59,318
<i>Jews are as bad as
communists and russians.</i>

392
00:45:59,597 --> 00:46:01,477
<i>Better dead than alive.</i>

393
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,477
<i>They shall die?
- Yes.</i>

394
00:46:25,753 --> 00:46:27,633
<i>Here. Move!</i>

395
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,543
Come on, get out!

396
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,940
Out.

397
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,540
Run!

398
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,258
Run!

399
00:48:12,373 --> 00:48:15,853
<i>What are we going to do with the jew?</i>

400
00:48:18,972 --> 00:48:21,772
<i>Leave him to me, you got it!?</i>

401
00:49:08,163 --> 00:49:12,843
<i>Herr Standartenführer. There was
a series of attacks in the outbacks.</i>

402
00:49:13,922 --> 00:49:15,642
What else?

403
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:17,962
New reports keep coming in.

404
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:22,121
50 bridges and 150km of track.
- We'll start a raid tomorrow.

405
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,040
There was a hint from the civilians.
Prepare everything!

406
00:49:56,234 --> 00:49:57,714
Get dressed!

407
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,225
Stop!

408
00:50:56,143 --> 00:50:59,183
I had this feeling from the very beginning

409
00:50:59,343 --> 00:51:01,903
The others said:

410
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:05,462
He is one, he looks like one.

411
00:51:07,141 --> 00:51:10,941
Yes, Viktor. Now I know it.

412
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,540
You're a German...

413
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,299
...and a Jew.

414
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:28,898
You were a good comrade.

415
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:35,937
But now I can't help you anymore.

416
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:41,455
Go!

417
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,133
Viktor!

418
00:52:00,132 --> 00:52:02,332
The war won't take much longer.

419
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:08,731
I wish you luck,
so you survive it.

420
00:52:47,723 --> 00:52:49,883
[Door opens]

421
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,721
Leave us alone!

422
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:14,238
Greta DelTorres.

423
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,678
3246.

424
00:53:18,877 --> 00:53:20,397
What do you want?

425
00:53:24,996 --> 00:53:26,796
I want you to sign this.

426
00:53:29,315 --> 00:53:31,955
That I helped your jewish friend.

427
00:53:34,894 --> 00:53:38,474
Does it look so bad,
that you need a jew now?

428
00:53:41,713 --> 00:53:43,833
Why, do you think it is,
that you're still alive?

429
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:47,432
And you can stay alive.

430
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,190
What kind of feeling is it,

431
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,990
to know, that he left you alone

432
00:54:03,149 --> 00:54:05,949
and is now safe in New York?

433
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:10,188
A good one.

434
00:54:20,706 --> 00:54:22,946
Don't think they'll save you!

435
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:24,906
Before even a single ally arrives here,

436
00:54:25,065 --> 00:54:26,785
you'll all be gone.

437
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:43,223
This was the last time.
We'll never meet again.

438
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:30,203
Get away, as long as you can.

439
00:56:33,762 --> 00:56:36,562
Have you heard anything about my parents?
How should I know, get lost!

440
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:38,481
The others? Greta?
Go!

441
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:40,761
What about her?

442
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,680
Arrested. Are you deaf!?
Bugger off!

443
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,880
Arrested?

444
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,759
Why? Why?

445
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:51,159
Defeatism.

446
00:56:52,278 --> 00:56:55,158
Defeatism? Greta?
That's impossible.

447
00:56:58,077 --> 00:57:02,597
Watch out Friedhelm!
On three, okay?

448
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:04,356
One...Two...

449
00:57:25,072 --> 00:57:27,952
Run away.
You won't get a second chance.

450
00:57:29,232 --> 00:57:31,512
What about you? The war is lost.
It's pointless.

451
00:57:31,671 --> 00:57:33,751
It was from the very beginning.

452
00:58:11,544 --> 00:58:16,104
"February 1945. The red army
crossed the Oder."

453
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:18,663
"Now it's less than 100km to Berlin."

454
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:22,662
"The war won't last much longer."

455
00:58:22,822 --> 00:58:26,622
"I'm just scared that the hope returns,
this close to the end.

456
00:59:09,053 --> 00:59:10,973
Russians!
Get down!

457
00:59:11,813 --> 00:59:14,013
What do we do now?

458
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:19,052
Hurry up!
This scumbag wants us to die here.

459
00:59:37,928 --> 00:59:39,528
What's his name?

460
00:59:39,688 --> 00:59:43,128
I don't know.
He just arrived this morning.

461
00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:45,487
Go!

462
00:59:55,765 --> 00:59:57,685
Spreader.

463
01:00:01,644 --> 01:00:03,524
Tweezers!

464
01:00:04,243 --> 01:00:08,643
The Russians have broken through
across the board.

465
01:00:11,522 --> 01:00:13,002
Pad!

466
01:00:16,561 --> 01:00:19,921
They are just 5 km away from here.

467
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,680
Stitch up, and put braces on.
But...

468
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,719
Evacuate everything! Now!

469
01:00:27,879 --> 01:00:32,079
What about those who can't be transported?
They stay here.

470

Have you seen Sonja?
The russian nurse? No.

483
01:01:43,045 --> 01:01:45,745
The Russian! We can't wait no longer.
Where is Sonja?

484
01:01:45,905 --> 01:01:48,865
No idea.
The Russians are only 500m away.

485
01:01:49,024 --> 01:01:51,184
Sonja!
Charlotte!

486
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:56,023
Come on! Faster!
We're departing now.

487
01:01:58,182 --> 01:01:59,662
Sonja?

488
01:02:01,622 --> 01:02:03,182
Sonja?

489
01:02:51,013 --> 01:02:53,613
Nurse!

490
01:02:53,772 --> 01:02:56,092
The Russians...

491
01:02:58,611 --> 01:03:00,411
Please.
Take them!

492
01:03:48,402 --> 01:03:50,882
<i>What's your name?
- Sonja Michailowa.</i>

493
01:03:56,721 --> 01:03:58,201
Sonja!

494
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,440
No, please don't!

495
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:39,154
<i>We're soviet soldiers!
Liberators - not rapists.</i>

496
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:42,113
<i>Get out of here,
if you don't want me to shoot you!</i>

497
01:04:47,612 --> 01:04:51,792
<i>Lilija. Thanks</i>

498
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:54,990
<i>Go away!</i>

499
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:56,150
<i>All of you!</i>

500
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:59,190
Sonja!

501
01:05:02,709 --> 01:05:04,029
<i>What happens to her?</i>

502
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:05,928
<i>She is a traitor.</i>

503
01:05:05,948 --> 01:05:06,988
<i>Go!</i>

504
01:05:10,227 --> 01:05:11,827
<i>Go!</i>

505
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,860
<i>Breslau ist surrounded.
We should try to...</i>

506
01:05:57,339 --> 01:05:59,139
Watch out. He's on the lookout.

507
01:06:00,578 --> 01:06:02,058
Get lost.

508
01:06:02,218 --> 01:06:04,338
What?

509
01:06:04,497 --> 01:06:06,257
Get lost!

510
01:06:24,174 --> 01:06:28,134
How many lives
does a scumbag like you have?

511
01:06:28,293 --> 01:06:30,093
I have only one left.

512
01:06:32,132 --> 01:06:34,132
I wanted to bid farewell.

513
01:06:39,571 --> 01:06:42,371
Do you know,
what I'm going to do to you?

514
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:53,269
My war is over.
And yours is as well.

515
01:07:17,164 --> 01:07:19,164
Come on! Help out here.

516
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,160
And now get lost!

517
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,559
You haven't seen anything.

518
01:07:53,638 --> 01:07:55,918
They won't believe me anyway.

519
01:08:44,948 --> 01:08:47,068
"This is the BBC home service."

520
01:08:47,228 --> 01:08:49,388
"Here is the news read by Frederic Dryfuss."

521
01:08:50,787 --> 01:08:54,027
"We begin
by taking listeners over direct

522
01:08:54,187 --> 01:08:56,707
to one of our transmitters in Germany
were Frank Gillard is waiting to speak..."

523
01:09:09,144 --> 01:09:11,944
Martin, please. Hurry up!

524
01:10:06,533 --> 01:10:08,533
Military police.

525
01:10:09,453 --> 01:10:11,853
We'll wait until it's dark.

526
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:48,686
<i>She is a nurse.
She can take care of our wounded.</i>

527
01:10:55,763 --> 01:10:58,363
<i>She can atone for her sins.</i>

528
01:10:58,924 --> 01:11:00,464
<i>In a few weeks we have won the war.</i>

529
01:11:00,483 --> 01:11:03,723
<i>With whom else
shall we build a better germany?</i>

530
01:11:11,242 --> 01:11:13,762
The nurse... ?

531
01:11:16,521 --> 01:11:18,001
Charly...

532
01:11:23,919 --> 01:11:28,799
How likely is it, as a soldier,
to return home alive?

533
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:32,758
So I just thought...
To save her the pain?

534
01:11:37,197 --> 01:11:38,677
Us.

535
01:11:47,695 --> 01:11:49,355
Did you count them...

536
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:51,635
...the ones you've killed?

537
01:11:52,114 --> 01:11:53,594
No.

538
01:11:54,914 --> 01:11:58,134
Twelve. I have killed twelve.

539
01:11:59,713 --> 01:12:01,713
And saved none..

540
01:12:03,112 --> 01:12:06,512
In the beginning you were a hero,
now you're just a bastard.

541
01:12:35,826 --> 01:12:37,426
<i>It was quicker for her that way.</i>

542
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:40,466
<i>She was sentenced to death.</i>

543
01:12:43,145 --> 01:12:45,665
<i>And why do you help me?</i>

544
01:12:47,384 --> 01:12:49,664
<i>Because it would just go on like this.</i>

545
01:12:52,263 --> 01:12:54,423
<i>See you in Berlin.</i>

546
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:39,204
Did you think we forgot you?

547
01:15:08,398 --> 01:15:10,998
Ten-hut! Aim!

548
01:15:16,717 --> 01:15:18,717
Fire!

549
01:15:47,631 --> 01:15:49,111
Wilhelm!

550
01:16:15,466 --> 01:16:16,946
That's my direction.

551
01:16:17,946 --> 01:16:19,426
Farewell!

552
01:16:20,865 --> 01:16:22,905
Farewell.

553
01:16:38,782 --> 01:16:41,342
"May 1945."

554
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:44,101
"Four years ago,
we bid farewell."

555
01:16:45,381 --> 01:16:47,021
"We were five friends

556
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:49,980
who thought,
the war would be over by christmas."

557
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:52,740
"Now it ends
where it began."

558
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:54,379
"In Berlin."

559
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:56,539
"Or what's left of it."

560
01:16:58,098 --> 01:17:01,938
"Soon there will only be Germans,
and not a single Nazi."

561
01:17:02,137 --> 01:17:03,897
"And who will we be?"

562
01:17:09,456 --> 01:17:11,256
Yeah?

563
01:17:15,455 --> 01:17:17,455
Hey 'here!
What's that s'pposed to be?

564
01:17:22,694 --> 01:17:25,454
What are you doin' in ma apartmend?

565
01:17:25,613 --> 01:17:28,173
Your apartment?
Yes.

566
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,053
Was it always yours?

567
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:33,252
Yeah. Why shouldn' it?

568
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:37,571
Really?

569
01:17:39,211 --> 01:17:42,491
Well, supposedly,
Jews used to live here

570
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:45,410
but 'hey have moved away.

571
01:17:54,808 --> 01:17:56,368
Hey, 'hat's enough!

572
01:18:05,466 --> 01:18:07,566
Yeah, I kept 'hat.

573
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:10,285
It's not like I ever had anything against 'hem.

574
01:18:11,165 --> 01:18:14,005
I always tried to help 'hem.

575
01:18:16,444 --> 01:18:18,244
Those... Jews.

576
01:19:07,835 --> 01:19:10,075
Cover!

577
01:19:10,234 --> 01:19:12,874
Cease fire!
Cease fire, goddamnit!

578
01:19:15,033 --> 01:19:16,513
You dumb fucks...

579
01:19:21,232 --> 01:19:26,192
<i>Germans surrender!
The war is over!</i>

580
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:12,013
"The German soldiers should give up.
War ees over."

581
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:15,652
These bastards are lying.
That's just propaganda.

582
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:17,931
If we surrender,
they'll just shoot us.

583
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:23,330
The Fuhrer has promised us that we will win.
- We still have rounds left.

584
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:26,970
How could we look into the
eyes of your mothers if we surrender?

585
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:30,249
Just be glad you can look
her in the eyes at all!

586
01:21:30,408 --> 01:21:33,328
You... You're an old, spineless coward!

587
01:21:38,007 --> 01:21:40,647
How old are you?
- Twelve.

588
01:21:42,646 --> 01:21:45,806
You're children.
The Russians will send you home.

589
01:22:00,403 --> 01:22:03,403
Please send this
to the adress on the back.

590
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,240
He's attacking them.

591
01:23:41,105 --> 01:23:42,585
Next!

592
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:47,584
Next please.

593
01:24:03,181 --> 01:24:04,661
Next please!

594
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,219
The Police and the administration
are looking for experienced staff.

595
01:24:14,379 --> 01:24:17,699
Do you have any experience?
Oh yes, quite a lot.

596
01:24:17,858 --> 01:24:20,418
<i>But not as much as you,
Sturmbannführer.</i>

597
01:24:22,137 --> 01:24:24,137
Do we know each other?

598
01:24:24,297 --> 01:24:27,057
To think that you
work at German administration...

599
01:24:27,216 --> 01:24:29,096
My experience is needed.

600
01:24:29,256 --> 01:24:31,976
Twelve years experience
in torturing and killing?

601
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:37,255
Please help me, I can't remember everyone.

602
01:24:38,934 --> 01:24:40,414
Captain.

603
01:24:42,094 --> 01:24:45,654
<i>This is Sturmbannführer Dorn
from the Gestapo.</i>

604
01:24:49,932 --> 01:24:51,412
You know that?

605
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:02,130
What happened to Greta?

606
01:25:05,129 --> 01:25:07,209
Viktor Goldstein.

607
01:25:08,769 --> 01:25:11,449
I've provided you with papers.

608
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:15,008
I provided this man with papers
so he could flee to Marseille.

609
01:25:16,087 --> 01:25:18,007
Greta, yeah.

610
01:25:19,367 --> 01:25:21,367
It's a real shame.

611
01:25:21,526 --> 01:25:23,686
I tried everything to save her.

612
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:29,925
Even I have almost lost my family.

613
01:25:31,365 --> 01:25:34,165
It's nice that you have survived.

614
01:25:41,723 --> 01:25:43,203
Next.

615
01:27:14,346 --> 01:21:52,146
(Sign: "Dancing to Swing is prohibited")

616
01:29:01,726 --> 01:29:04,246
We don't have to wait for Friedhelm.

617
01:29:09,725 --> 01:29:13,125
Fallen, for Fuhrer,
People and Fatherland.

618
01:29:17,323 --> 01:29:19,483
Anyone heard anything from Greta?

619
01:30:01,075 --> 01:30:03,075
It's good you're alive.

620
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,030
To Friedhelm and Greta!
