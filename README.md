# FAST Deep Learning Workshops
This Repository contains all the content which was either taught or is relevant to the Workshops conducted by me as a Teacher's Assistent in the Fall 2018 Semester in FAST National University to the students of CS 5102 - Deep Learning Course, taught by Dr. Muhammad Usman Sadiq, offered to the Masters of Science in Data Science program.

# Announcements:
1. The workshops are ungraded and may or may not have attendance.
2. There will be 2-3 workshops conducted throughout the semester.
3. There will be no makeup for missed workshops.
4. All the content and the supplementary resources related to the workshop will be made available to this repository.
5. The workshops will begin from 5:15 pm onwards irrespective of the day.
6. The date of the workshop will be disclosed at most week before the workshop. But, as a rough idea, the workshops will be conducted either on Tuesday or Thursday.
